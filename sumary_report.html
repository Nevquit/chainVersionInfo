      <td># Litecoin Core v0.18.1 Release</br></br>*Follow our *[*Twitter*](https://twitter.com/litecoinproject)* for the latest dev news.*</br></br>We are pleased to release Litecoin Core 0.18.1. This is a new major version release, including new features, various bugfixes and performance improvements, as well as updated translations. It is recommended for all users to upgrade to this version.</br></br>How to Upgrade</br>==============</br></br>If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Litecoin-Qt` (on Mac) or `litecoind`/`litecoin-qt` (on Linux).</br></br>The first time you run version 0.15.0 or newer, your chainstate database will be converted to a new format, which will take anywhere from a few minutes to half an hour, depending on the speed of your machine.</br></br>Note that the block database format also changed in version 0.8.0 and there is no automatic upgrade code from before version 0.8 to version 0.15.0 or later. Upgrading directly from 0.7.x and earlier without redownloading the blockchain is not supported. However, as usual, old wallet versions are still supported.</br></br>Compatibility</br>=============</br></br>Litecoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.10+, and Windows 7 and newer. It is not recommended to use Litecoin Core on unsupported systems.</br></br>Litecoin Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as frequently tested on them.</br></br>From 0.17.0 onwards, macOS &lt;10.10 is no longer supported. 0.17.0 is built using Qt 5.9.x, which doesn't support versions of macOS older than 10.10. Additionally, Litecoin Core does not yet change appearance when macOS "dark mode" is activated.</br></br>In addition to previously-supported CPU platforms, this release's pre-compiled distribution also provides binaries for the RISC-V platform.</br></br>Known issues</br>============</br></br>Wallet GUI</br>----------</br></br>For advanced users who have both (1) enabled coin control features, and (2) are using multiple wallets loaded at the same time: The coin control input selection dialog can erroneously retain wrong-wallet state when switching wallets using the dropdown menu. For now, it is recommended not to use coin control features with multiple wallets loaded.</br></br>Notable changes</br>===============</br></br>Mining</br>------</br></br>-   Calls to `getblocktemplate` will fail if the segwit rule is not specified. Calling `getblocktemplate` without segwit specified is almost certainly a misconfiguration since doing so results in lower rewards for the miner. Failed calls will produce an error message describing how to enable the segwit rule.</br></br>Configuration option changes</br>----------------------------</br></br>-   A warning is printed if an unrecognized section name is used in the configuration file. Recognized sections are `[test]`, `[main]`, and `[regtest]`.</br>-   Four new options are available for configuring the maximum number of messages that ZMQ will queue in memory (the "high water mark") before dropping additional messages. The default value is 1,000, the same as was used for previous releases. See the [ZMQ documentation](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/blob/master/doc/zmq.md#usage) for details.</br>-   The `rpcallowip` option can no longer be used to automatically listen on all network interfaces. Instead, the `rpcbind` parameter must be used to specify the IP addresses to listen on. Listening for RPC commands over a public network connection is insecure and should be disabled, so a warning is now printed if a user selects such a configuration. If you need to expose RPC in order to use a tool like Docker, ensure you only bind RPC to your localhost, e.g. `docker run [...] -p 127.0.0.1:9332:9332` (this is an extra `:9332` over the normal Docker port specification).</br>-   The `rpcpassword` option now causes a startup error if the password set in the configuration file contains a hash character (#), as it's ambiguous whether the hash character is meant for the password or as a comment.</br>-   The `whitelistforcerelay` option is used to relay transactions from whitelisted peers even when not accepted to the mempool. This option now defaults to being off, so that changes in policy and disconnect/ban behavior will not cause a node that is whitelisting another to be dropped by peers. Users can still explicitly enable this behavior with the command line option (and may want to consider [contacting](mailto:contact@litecoin.org) the Litecoin Core project to let us know about their use-case, as this feature could be deprecated in the future).</br></br>Wallet changes</br>==============</br></br>When creating a transaction with a fee above `-maxtxfee` (default 0.1 LTC), the RPC commands `walletcreatefundedpsbt` and `fundrawtransaction` will now fail instead of rounding down the fee. Beware that the `feeRate` argument is specified in LTC per kilobyte, not litoshi per byte.</br></br>Documentation</br>=============</br></br>-   A new short [document](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/blob/master/doc/JSON-RPC-interface.md) about the JSON-RPC interface describes cases where the results of an RPC might contain inconsistencies between data sourced from different subsystems, such as wallet state and mempool state. A note is added to the [REST interface documentation](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/blob/master/doc/REST-interface.md) indicating that the same rules apply.</br>-   Further information is added to the [JSON-RPC documentation](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/blob/master/doc/JSON-RPC-interface.md) about how to secure this interface.</br>-   A new [document](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/blob/master/doc/litecoin-conf.md) about the `litecoin.conf` file describes how to use it to configure Litecoin Core.</br>-   A new document introduces Litecoin Core's BIP174 [Partially-Signed Litecoin Transactions (PSBT)](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/blob/master/doc/psbt.md) interface, which is used to allow multiple programs to collaboratively work to create, sign, and broadcast new transactions. This is useful for offline (cold storage) wallets, multisig wallets, coinjoin implementations, and many other cases where two or more programs need to interact to generate a complete transaction.</br>-   The [output script descriptor](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/blob/master/doc/descriptors.md) documentation has been updated with information about new features in this still-developing language for describing the output scripts that a wallet or other program wants to receive notifications for, such as which addresses it wants to know received payments. The language is currently used in multiple new and updated RPCs described in these release notes and is expected to be adapted to other RPCs and to the underlying wallet structure.</br></br>Build system changes</br>====================</br></br>-   A new `--disable-bip70` option may be passed to `./configure` to prevent Litecoin-Qt from being built with support for the BIP70 payment protocol or from linking libssl. As the payment protocol has exposed Litecoin Core to libssl vulnerabilities in the past, builders who don't need BIP70 support are encouraged to use this option to reduce their exposure to future vulnerabilities.</br>-   The minimum required version of Qt (when building the GUI) has been increased from 5.2 to 5.5.1 (the [depends system](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/blob/master/depends/README.md) provides 5.9.7)</br></br>New RPCs</br>========</br></br>-   `getnodeaddresses` returns peer addresses known to this node. It may be used to find nodes to connect to without using a DNS seeder.</br>-   `listwalletdir` returns a list of wallets in the wallet directory (either the default wallet directory or the directory configured by the `-walletdir` parameter).</br>-   `getrpcinfo` returns runtime details of the RPC server. At the moment, it returns an array of the currently active commands and how long they've been running.</br>-   `deriveaddresses` returns one or more addresses corresponding to an [output descriptor](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/blob/master/doc/descriptors.md).</br>-   `getdescriptorinfo` accepts a descriptor and returns information about it, including its computed checksum.</br>-   `joinpsbts` merges multiple distinct PSBTs into a single PSBT. The multiple PSBTs must have different inputs. The resulting PSBT will contain every input and output from all of the PSBTs. Any signatures provided in any of the PSBTs will be dropped.</br>-   `analyzepsbt` examines a PSBT and provides information about what the PSBT contains and the next steps that need to be taken in order to complete the transaction. For each input of a PSBT, `analyzepsbt` provides information about what information is missing for that input, including whether a UTXO needs to be provided, what pubkeys still need to be provided, which scripts need to be provided, and what signatures are still needed. Every input will also list which role is needed to complete that input, and `analyzepsbt` will also list the next role in general needed to complete the PSBT. `analyzepsbt` will also provide the estimated fee rate and estimated virtual size of the completed transaction if it has enough information to do so.</br>-   `utxoupdatepsbt` searches the set of Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) to find the outputs being spent by the partial transaction. PSBTs need to have the UTXOs being spent to be provided because the signing algorithm requires information from the UTXO being spent. For segwit inputs, only the UTXO itself is necessary. For non-segwit outputs, the entire previous transaction is needed so that signers can be sure that they are signing the correct thing. Unfortunately, because the UTXO set only contains UTXOs and not full transactions, `utxoupdatepsbt` will only add the UTXO for segwit inputs.</br></br>Updated RPCs</br>============</br></br>Note: some low-level RPC changes mainly useful for testing are described in the Low-level Changes section below.</br></br>-   `getpeerinfo` now returns an additional `minfeefilter` field set to the peer's BIP133 fee filter. You can use this to detect that you have peers that are willing to accept transactions below the default minimum relay fee.</br>-   The mempool RPCs, such as `getrawmempool` with `verbose=true`, now return an additional "bip125-replaceable" value indicating whether the transaction (or its unconfirmed ancestors) opts-in to asking nodes and miners to replace it with a higher-feerate transaction spending any of the same inputs.</br>-   `settxfee` previously silently ignored attempts to set the fee below the allowed minimums. It now prints a warning. The special value of "0" may still be used to request the minimum value.</br>-   `getaddressinfo` now provides an `ischange` field indicating whether the wallet used the address in a change output.</br>-   `importmulti` has been updated to support P2WSH, P2WPKH, P2SH-P2WPKH, and P2SH-P2WSH. Requests for P2WSH and P2SH-P2WSH accept an additional `witnessscript` parameter.</br>-   `importmulti` now returns an additional `warnings` field for each request with an array of strings explaining when fields are being ignored or are inconsistent, if there are any.</br>-   `getaddressinfo` now returns an additional `solvable` boolean field when Litecoin Core knows enough about the address's scriptPubKey, optional redeemScript, and optional witnessScript in order for the wallet to be able to generate an unsigned input spending funds sent to that address.</br>-   The `getaddressinfo`, `listunspent`, and `scantxoutset` RPCs now return an additional `desc` field that contains an output descriptor containing all key paths and signing information for the address (except for the private key). The `desc` field is only returned for `getaddressinfo` and `listunspent` when the address is solvable.</br>-   `importprivkey` will preserve previously-set labels for addresses or public keys corresponding to the private key being imported. For example, if you imported a watch-only address with the label "cold wallet" in earlier releases of Litecoin Core, subsequently importing the private key would default to resetting the address's label to the default empty-string label (""). In this release, the previous label of "cold wallet" will be retained. If you optionally specify any label besides the default when calling `importprivkey`, the new label will be applied to the address.</br>-   See the [Mining](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/blob/v0.18.1rc1/doc/release-notes-litecoin.md#mining) section for changes to `getblocktemplate`.</br>-   `getmininginfo` now omits `currentblockweight` and `currentblocktx` when a block was never assembled via RPC on this node.</br>-   The `getrawtransaction` RPC &amp; REST endpoints no longer check the unspent UTXO set for a transaction. The remaining behaviors are as follows: 1. If a blockhash is provided, check the corresponding block. 2. If no blockhash is provided, check the mempool. 3. If no blockhash is provided but txindex is enabled, also check txindex.</br>-   `unloadwallet` is now synchronous, meaning it will not return until the wallet is fully unloaded.</br>-   `importmulti` now supports importing of addresses from descriptors. A "desc" parameter can be provided instead of the "scriptPubKey" in a request, as well as an optional range for ranged descriptors to specify the start and end of the range to import. Descriptors with key origin information imported through `importmulti` will have their key origin information stored in the wallet for use with creating PSBTs. More information about descriptors can be found [here](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/blob/master/doc/descriptors.md).</br>-   `listunspent` has been modified so that it also returns `witnessScript`, the witness script in the case of a P2WSH or P2SH-P2WSH output.</br>-   `createwallet` now has an optional `blank` argument that can be used to create a blank wallet. Blank wallets do not have any keys or HD seed. They cannot be opened in software older than 0.18. Once a blank wallet has a HD seed set (by using `sethdseed`) or private keys, scripts, addresses, and other watch only things have been imported, the wallet is no longer blank and can be opened in 0.17.x. Encrypting a blank wallet will also set a HD seed for it.</br></br>Deprecated or removed RPCs</br>==========================</br></br>-   `signrawtransaction` is removed after being deprecated and hidden behind a special configuration option in version 0.17.0.</br>-   The 'account' API is removed after being deprecated in v0.17. The 'label' API was introduced in v0.17 as a replacement for accounts. See the [release notes from v0.17](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.17.0.md#label-and-account-apis-for-wallet) for a full description of the changes from the 'account' API to the 'label' API.</br>-   `addwitnessaddress` is removed after being deprecated in version 0.16.0.</br>-   `generate` is deprecated and will be fully removed in a subsequent major version. This RPC is only used for testing, but its implementation reached across multiple subsystems (wallet and mining), so it is being deprecated to simplify the wallet-node interface. Projects that are using `generate` for testing purposes should transition to using the `generatetoaddress` RPC, which does not require or use the wallet component. Calling `generatetoaddress` with an address returned by the `getnewaddress` RPC gives the same functionality as the old `generate` RPC. To continue using `generate` in this version, restart litecoind with the `-deprecatedrpc=generate` configuration option.</br>-   Be reminded that parts of the `validateaddress` command have been deprecated and moved to `getaddressinfo`. The following deprecated fields have moved to `getaddressinfo`: `ismine`, `iswatchonly`, `script`, `hex`, `pubkeys`, `sigsrequired`, `pubkey`, `embedded`, `iscompressed`, `label`, `timestamp`, `hdkeypath`, `hdmasterkeyid`.</br>-   The `addresses` field has been removed from the `validateaddress` and `getaddressinfo` RPC methods. This field was confusing since it referred to public keys using their P2PKH address. Clients should use the `embedded.address` field for P2SH or P2WSH wrapped addresses, and `pubkeys` for inspecting multisig participants.</br></br>REST changes</br>============</br></br>-   A new `/rest/blockhashbyheight/` endpoint is added for fetching the hash of the block in the current best blockchain based on its height (how many blocks it is after the Genesis Block).</br></br>Graphical User Interface (GUI)</br>==============================</br></br>-   A new Window menu is added alongside the existing File, Settings, and Help menus. Several items from the other menus that opened new windows have been moved to this new Window menu.</br>-   In the Send tab, the checkbox for "pay only the required fee" has been removed. Instead, the user can simply decrease the value in the Custom Feerate field all the way down to the node's configured minimum relay fee.</br>-   In the Overview tab, the watch-only balance will be the only balance shown if the wallet was created using the `createwallet` RPC and the `disable_private_keys` parameter was set to true.</br>-   The launch-on-startup option is no longer available on macOS if compiled with macosx min version greater than 10.11 (use CXXFLAGS="-mmacosx-version-min=10.11" CFLAGS="-mmacosx-version-min=10.11" for setting the deployment sdk version)</br></br>Tools</br>=====</br></br>-   A new `litecoin-wallet` tool is now distributed alongside Litecoin Core's other executables. Without needing to use any RPCs, this tool can currently create a new wallet file or display some basic information about an existing wallet, such as whether the wallet is encrypted, whether it uses an HD seed, how many transactions it contains, and how many address book entries it has.</br></br>Planned changes</br>===============</br></br>This section describes planned changes to Litecoin Core that may affect other Litecoin software and services.</br></br>-   Since version 0.16.0, Litecoin Core's built-in wallet has defaulted to generating P2SH-wrapped segwit addresses when users want to receive payments. These addresses are backwards compatible with all widely-used software. Starting with Litecoin Core 0.20, Litecoin Core will default to native segwit addresses (bech32) that provide additional fee savings and other benefits. Currently, many wallets and services already support sending to bech32 addresses, and if the Litecoin Core project sees enough additional adoption, it will instead default to bech32 receiving addresses in Litecoin Core 0.20. P2SH-wrapped segwit addresses will continue to be provided if the user requests them in the GUI or by RPC, and anyone who doesn't want the update will be able to configure their default address type. (Similarly, pioneering users who want to change their default now may set the `addresstype=bech32` configuration option in any Litecoin Core release from 0.16.0 up.)</br></br>Deprecated P2P messages</br>=======================</br></br>-   BIP 61 reject messages are now deprecated. Reject messages have no use case on the P2P network and are only logged for debugging by most network nodes. Furthermore, they increase bandwidth and can be harmful for privacy and security. It has been possible to disable BIP 61 messages since v0.17 with the `-enablebip61=0` option. BIP 61 messages will be disabled by default in a future version, before being removed entirely.</br></br>Low-level changes</br>=================</br></br>This section describes RPC changes mainly useful for testing, mostly not relevant in production. The changes are mentioned for completeness.</br></br>RPC</br>===</br></br>-   The `submitblock` RPC previously returned the reason a rejected block was invalid the first time it processed that block, but returned a generic "duplicate" rejection message on subsequent occasions it processed the same block. It now always returns the fundamental reason for rejecting an invalid block and only returns "duplicate" for valid blocks it has already accepted.</br>-   A new `submitheader` RPC allows submitting block headers independently from their block. This is likely only useful for testing.</br>-   The `signrawtransactionwithkey` and `signrawtransactionwithwallet` RPCs have been modified so that they also optionally accept a `witnessScript`, the witness script in the case of a P2WSH or P2SH-P2WSH output. This is compatible with the change to `listunspent`.</br>-   For the `walletprocesspsbt` and `walletcreatefundedpsbt` RPCs, if the `bip32derivs` parameter is set to true but the key metadata for a public key has not been updated yet, then that key will have a derivation path as if it were just an independent key (i.e. no derivation path and its master fingerprint is itself).</br></br>Configuration</br>=============</br></br>-   The `-usehd` configuration option was removed in version 0.16. From that version onwards, all new wallets created are hierarchical deterministic wallets. This release makes specifying `-usehd` an invalid configuration option.</br></br>Network</br>=======</br></br>-   This release allows peers that your node automatically disconnected for misbehavior (e.g. sending invalid data) to reconnect to your node if you have unused incoming connection slots. If your slots fill up, a misbehaving node will be disconnected to make room for nodes without a history of problems (unless the misbehaving node helps your node in some other way, such as by connecting to a part of the Internet from which you don't have many other peers). Previously, Litecoin Core banned the IP addresses of misbehaving peers for a period of time (default of 1 day); this was easily circumvented by attackers with multiple IP addresses. If you manually ban a peer, such as by using the `setban` RPC, all connections from that peer will still be rejected.</br></br>Wallet</br>======</br></br>-   The key metadata will need to be upgraded the first time that the HD seed is available. For unencrypted wallets this will occur on wallet loading. For encrypted wallets this will occur the first time the wallet is unlocked.</br>-   Newly encrypted wallets will no longer require restarting the software. Instead such wallets will be completely unloaded and reloaded to achieve the same effect.</br>-   A sub-project of Litecoin Core now provides Hardware Wallet Interaction (HWI) scripts that allow command-line users to use several popular hardware key management devices with Litecoin Core. See their [project page](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/HWI#readme) for details.</br></br>Security</br>========</br></br>-   This release changes the Random Number Generator (RNG) used from OpenSSL to Litecoin Core's own implementation, although entropy gathered by Litecoin Core is fed out to OpenSSL and then read back in when the program needs strong randomness. This moves Litecoin Core a little closer to no longer needing to depend on OpenSSL, a dependency that has caused security issues in the past. The new implementation gathers entropy from multiple sources, including from hardware supporting the rdseed CPU instruction.</br></br>Changes for particular platforms</br>================================</br></br>-   On macOS, Litecoin Core now opts out of application CPU throttling ("app nap") during initial blockchain download, when catching up from over 100 blocks behind the current chain tip, or when reindexing chain data. This helps prevent these operations from taking an excessively long time because the operating system is attempting to conserve power.</br></br>Download Binaries</br>=================</br></br>To download, please visit the download page [here](https://litecoin.org/). Alternatively, you can view the download folder [here](https://download.litecoin.org/litecoin-0.18.1/).</br></br>Please use GPG to verify the integrity of the release binaries. This ensures that the binary you have downloaded has not been tampered with. Linux, MacOS and Win32 cygwin command line GPG instructions are available [here](https://download.litecoin.org/README-HOWTO-GPG-VERIFY-TEAM-MEMBERS-KEY.txt). Please also note that we GPG sign the binaries as a convenience to you, the ultimate way to verify the integrity of the builds is to build them yourself using Gitian.

      <td>## Version 1.8.5</br>This is the 1.8.5 release of `rippled`, the reference implementation of the XRP Ledger protocol. This release includes fixes and updates for stability and security, and improvements to build scripts. There are no user-facing API or protocol changes in this release.</br></br>### Bug Fixes</br></br>This release contains the following bug fixes and under-the-hood improvements:</br></br>- **Correct TaggedPointer move constructor:** Fixes a bug in unused code for the TaggedPointer class. The old code would fail if a caller explicitly tried to remove a child that is not actually part of the node. ([61389a8](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commit/61389a8befd79104534f32275394ffb953196741))</br></br>- **Ensure protocol buffer prerequisites are present:** The build scripts and packages now properly handle Protobuf packages and various packages. Prior to this change, building on Ubuntu 21.10 Impish Indri would fail unless the `libprotoc-dev` package was installed. ([b7e0306](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commit/b7e0306d0a69427055d33fe8b75a982b24f7f2f4))</br></br>- **Improve handling of endpoints during peer discovery.** This hardens and improves handling of incoming messages on the peer protocol. ([289bc0a](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commit/289bc0afd928ce45dd919115c65ea7290f59eecd))</br></br>- **Run tests on updated linux distros:** Test builds now run on Rocky Linux 8, Fedora 34 and 35, Ubuntu 18, 20, and 22, and Debian 9, 10, and 11. ([a9ee802](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commit/a9ee802240e92954d021caedde5ef749253d1a36))</br></br>- **Avoid dereferencing empty optional in ReportingETL:** Fixes a bug in Reporting Mode that could dereference an empty optional value when throwing an error. ([5b085a7](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commit/5b085a75fd4f2a28804f15f6559a5ecd4d862d81))</br></br>- **Correctly add GIT_COMMIT_HASH into version string:** When building the server from a non-tagged release, the build files now add the commit ID in a way that follows the semantic-versioning standard, and correctly handle the case where the commit hash ID cannot be retrieved. ([d23d37f](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commit/d23d37fcfd8a1126bedb033f4f07089488720d29))</br></br>- **Update RocksDB to version 6.27.3:** Updates the version of RocksDB included in the server from 6.7.3 (which was released on 2020-03-18) to 6.27.3 (released 2021-12-10). ([c5dc00a](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commit/c5dc00af74eb22132b74570d7274360642dc7599))</td>

      <td># Release Notes for Bitcoin Cash Node version 24.0.0</br></br>Bitcoin Cash Node version 24.0.0 is now available from:</br></br>  &lt;https://bitcoincashnode.org&gt;</br></br>## Overview</br></br>This is a major release of Bitcoin Cash Node (BCHN) that implements the [May 15, 2022 Network Upgrade](https://upgradespecs.bitcoincashnode.org/2022-05-15-upgrade/). This release implements the following two consensus CHIPs:</br></br>- [CHIP-2021-03: Bigger Script Integers](https://gitlab.com/GeneralProtocols/research/chips/-/blob/master/CHIP-2021-02-Bigger-Script-Integers.md) increased precision for arithmetic operations.</br>- [CHIP-2021-02: Native Introspection Opcodes](https://gitlab.com/GeneralProtocols/research/chips/-/blob/master/CHIP-2021-02-Add-Native-Introspection-Opcodes.md) enabling smart contracts to inspect the current transaction.</br></br>This version contains further corrections and improvements, such as:</br></br>- [BIP69](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0069.mediawiki) (privacy) lexicographical sorting of transaction inputs/outputs</br>- A new wallet RPC call attribute ('include_unsafe') which enables creation of transactions which spend unconfirmed outputs (the default is still to spend only confirmed transactions)</br>- New settings, confirmation and error messages for the GUI to detect and warn the user about error-prone legacy address types.</br>- Update of the seeds and addition of a new seeder (bitjson.com)</br></br>Users who are running any of our previous releases (23.x.y) are urged to upgrade to v24.0.0 ahead of May 2022.</br></br></br>## Usage recommendations</br></br>The update to Bitcoin Cash Node 24.0.0 is required for the May 15, 2022 Bitcoin Cash network upgrade.</br></br></br>## Network changes</br></br>This release brings two consensus CHIPs (increased precision for arithmetic operations and native introspection opcodes) and one optional network change - BIP69 - the sorting of inputs and output in transactions generated by the wallet.</br></br>The first two (consensus changes) take effect with the upgrade in 15 May 2022.</br></br>BIP69 is effective immediately and enabled by default in this release. The pre-BIP69 behavior can be obtained by passing `-usebip69=0` on startup.</br></br></br>## Added functionality</br></br>- After activation of the May 2022 upgrade, smart contract designers will be able to use OP_MUL, native introspection opcodes and higher-precision integers in Script code.</br></br>- `coinsel` option has been added to `sendmany` RPC call. This was done to keep uniformity with 'sendtoaddress'.</br></br>- A new option `-usebip69` has been added to toggle BIP69 usage (it is enabled by default). This sorts the inputs and outputs of a transaction</br>  in lexicographical order to increase transactional privacy.</br></br>- The `fundrawtransaction`, `sendmany`, `sendtoaddress` and `walletcreatefundedpsbt` RPCs now support an `include_unsafe` option that, when `true`, allows using "unsafe inputs" to fund the transaction. The term "unsafe inputs" is a synonym for unconfirmed inputs not originating   from the wallet.  Note that the resulting transaction may become invalid if one of the "unsafe" inputs disappears due to a double-spend. This is a very unlikely scenario, however, on account of the strong zero-conf properties of the BCH network.  However, if that happens, the transaction must be funded with different inputs and republished.</br></br>- Two new options have been added to make legacy address handling safer in the GUI wallet: "Allow legacy P2PKH addresses" under Options &gt; Wallet and the `-allowlegacyp2sh` configuration option.</br></br>- A new CLI argument `-bytespersigcheck` has been introduced (conf file: `bytespersigcheck`). It is identical to the existing argument `-bytespersigop` (which has been deprecated), and the two arguments are now aliases for one other.</br></br>- A new option `-upgrade9activationtime` has been added to control the timestamp of the tentative upgrade in May 2023. This value is also used</br>  to set the software expiry time.</br></br>## Deprecated functionality</br></br>- The CLI argument `-bytespersigop` (conf file: `bytespersigop`) has been deprecated. Use `-bytespersigcheck` instead.</br></br>## Modified functionality</br></br>- The software expiry deadline has now been shifted from 15 May 2022 to 15 May 2023.</br></br>## Removed functionality</br></br>### autotools build system</br></br>The autotools build system is no longer supported by BCHN and has been removed. Please use the CMake / ninja build system.</br></br>### Mempool acceptance 'height' field in RPC calls</br></br>The `getmempoolentry` RPC call, the verbose modes of the `getrawmempool`/`getmempoolancestors`/`getmempooldescendants` RPC calls, and the JSON mode of the mempool REST call no longer include the `height` field. This used to indicate the block height upon mempool acceptance. However, it was not guaranteed to be accurate after a node restart or reorg, thus limiting its usefulness. Since it has been marked as deprecated for some time, it has been removed in the interests of efficiency.</br></br>### No more PPA support for Ubuntu 16.04</br></br>Ubuntu 16.04 is no longer supported via a PPA.</br></br>Users are encouraged to migrate to a more recent version of Ubuntu if they wish to use the Ubuntu PPAs.</br></br>Users who wish to compile from source are advised that the autotools build system is no longer supported from this release onwards.</br></br>## New RPC methods</br></br>None.</br></br>## User interface changes</br></br>Legacy address handling has been made safer in the GUI wallet. The aim is to save users from losing coins while using the error-prone legacy P2PKH and P2SH address types.</br></br>Such receiving address types are detected and the user is given relevant confirmation dialogs and error messages. For this legacy address handling, two new settings are introduced, one for P2PKH and one for P2SH addresses, to configure whether or not use of these legacy address types is allowed. These settings are:</br></br>- "Allow legacy P2PKH addresses" under Options &gt; Wallet</br>- `-allowlegacyp2sh` configuration option</br></br>## Regressions</br></br>Bitcoin Cash Node 24.0.0 does not introduce any known regressions as compared to 23.1.0.</br></br>## Known Issues</br></br>Some issues could not be closed in time for release, but we are tracking all of them on our GitLab repository.</br></br>- MacOS versions earlier than 10.12 are no longer supported. Additionally, Bitcoin Cash Node does not yet change appearance when macOS "dark mode" is activated.</br></br>- Windows users are recommended not to run multiple instances of bitcoin-qt or bitcoind on the same machine if the wallet feature is enabled.</br>  There is risk of data corruption if instances are configured to use the same wallet folder.</br></br>- Some users have encountered unit tests failures when running in WSL environments (e.g. WSL/Ubuntu).  At this time, WSL is not considered a supported environment for the software. This may change in future. The functional failure on WSL is tracked in [Issue #33](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/33). It arises when competing node program instances are not prevented from opening the same wallet folder. Running multiple program instances with the same configured walletdir could potentially lead to data corruption. The failure has not been observed on other operating systems so far.</br></br>- `doc/dependencies.md` needs revision ([Issue #65](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/65)).</br></br>- `test_bitcoin` can collide with temporary files if used by more than one user on the same system simultaneously. ([Issue #43](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/43))</br></br>- For users running from sources built with BerkeleyDB releases newer than the 5.3 which is used in this release, please take into consideration the database format compatibility issues described in [Issue #34](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/34). When building from source it is recommended to use BerkeleyDB 5.3 as this voids wallet database incompatibility issues with the official release.</br></br>- The `test_bitcoin-qt` test executable fails on Linux Mint 20 (see [Issue #144](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/144)). This does not otherwise appear to impact the functioning of the BCHN software on that platform.</br></br>- With a certain combination of build flags that included disabling the QR code library, a build failure was observed where an erroneous linking against the QR code library (not present) was attempted ([Issue #138](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/138)).</br></br>- Some functional tests are known to fail spuriously with varying probability. (see e.g. [Issue #148](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/148), and a fuller listing in [Issue #162](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/162)).</br></br>- Possible out-of-memory error when starting bitcoind with high excessiveblocksize value ([Issue #156](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/156))</br></br>- A problem was observed on scalenet where nodes would sometimes hang for around 10 minutes, accepting RPC connections but not responding to them (see [Issue #210](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/210)).</br></br>- Startup and shutdown time of nodes on scalenet can be long (see [Issue #313](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/313)).</br></br>- On some platforms, the splash screen can be maximized, but it cannot be unmaximized again (see [Issue #255](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/255)). This has only been observed on Mac OSX, not on Linux or Windows builds.</br></br>- There is an issue with `git-lfs` that may interfere with the refreshing of source code checkouts which have not been updated for a longer time (see Issues [#326](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/326), [#333](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/333)). A known workaround is to do a fresh clone of the repository.</br></br>---</br></br>## Changes since Bitcoin Cash Node 23.1.0</br></br>### New documents</br></br>The following are new documents in the BCHN software repository:</br></br>- [doc/gitian-building/gitian-building-docker.md](doc/gitian-building/gitian-building-docker.md): Adds a new streamlined Gitian setup guide tailored for Ubuntu/Debian users with Docker</br>- [doc/release-notes/release-notes-23.1.0.md](doc/release-notes/release-notes-23.1.0.md): The previous Release Notes</br></br>### Removed documents</br></br>None.</br></br>### Notable commits grouped by functionality</br></br>#### Security or consensus relevant fixes</br></br>None.</br></br>#### Interfaces / RPC</br></br>- af8ee2666dbd7653240117620ac96084b05fdae0 Bigger script integers (64-bit) implementation</br>- 05681fd0a614688430554b23b76fc01b8addb38a Implement bip69 and use in CWallet::CreateTransaction by default</br>- 4044ae2232059f6e96d2bc84179d56e5b6446506 Implementation of the Native Introspection proposal</br>- eff23d7d95e3cb47ef3f4aacbdcc1fac1347cfd4 Remove mempool acceptance block height field</br></br>#### Performance optimizations</br></br>- 3b44c66d9b10f30a954dac879e71ce0357b92b5a Remove `CTxMemPool::vTxHashes`</br></br>#### GUI</br></br>- 70460780ed480c22a917ca09a9614f1264f974b1 [qt][wallet] Safer legacy address handling for the GUI wallet</br>- 4e48ab0caac1b676a041fddcaba14c66e01f41ae Add guards and replace removed QWidget dependency</br></br>#### Data directory changes</br></br>None.</br></br>#### Code quality</br></br>- 60ae4cb4abf1d2b6d5eb71c2af69da9d39fd5b79 [qa] Fix compile warning about shadowed local in wallet_tests.cpp</br>- 5aba2e5381001c01b54c890e8bd9693f813b4946 [tests] Trivial: End object lifetime properly in a uint256 test</br>- ddfe6f4d4db8f08c165794da6119a63a2b32d682 Fix UB use of reinterpret_cast when working with sockets</br>- cfeb4093db9771889aa54b62985a8afc08b4e3c4 Fix compile warnings on newer clang</br>- bc30e7ad646554bf084e851a35d336b692f63c6f Remove old check for 3-byte shifted IP addresses from pre-0.2.9 node messages</br>- 234798dd814c55b6d44dabf37983a95d5c4b43b6 [qa] Update blockchain data sizes for mainnet, scalenet for v24.0.0</br>- fdb053f4d5666b152dc9751d1d30036798647d3c [qa] Update chain params (assumed valid and chainwork) for v24.0.0</br></br>#### Documentation updates</br></br>- b9edb72b06a1223f1761989be6ad649467f6ac5c [build][doc] Add Gitian on Docker guide &amp;
