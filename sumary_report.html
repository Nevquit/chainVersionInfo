      <td>This is a new minor version release, including important security updates and changes to network efficiency.</br></br>**All Dogecoin Core users - miners, services, relay operators and wallet users - are strongly recommended to upgrade.**</br></br>A full description of all changes is available in the [release notes](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes.md)</br></br>### Security-related fixes</br></br>This release contains multiple security related fixes:</br></br>- The alert system has been removed and processing of alert messages has been disabled</br>- The transaction download system has been made more reliable</br>- The protocol implementation has been amended to reject buggy or malformed messages</br>- Memory management in events of high network traffic or when connected to extremely slow peers has been improved</br></br>### Fee Recommendation</br></br>This release changes the **recommended dust limit** for all participants on the Dogecoin network from 1 DOGE to **0.01 DOGE**. The full recommendation can be found [in the documentation](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/blob/1.14.6-dev/doc/fee-recommendation.md).</br></br>### Breaking changes</br></br>- The behavior of the `dumpwallet` and `backupwallet` RPC methods, to exclusively write to the directory specified by `-backupdir` and no longer overwrite files</br>- The maximum number of `addnode` records that a node will track has been limited to 800</br></br>### New features</br></br>- A new RPC method, `liststucktransactions` has been added to help wallet operators identify if any transactions are stuck (have not been mined and are not in the mempool) and enable resolution. This helps in cases where node-local fee or dust policies change, to prevent the node from sending out old transactions that got lost.</br>- Pruning configuration has been added to the UI, to make it easier to save diskspace for users of graphical (wallet) installations. </br>- A new RPC method, `setmaxconnections`, has been introduced that enables wallet and node operators to change the maximum number of connections their node allows without needing to restart allowing for more fine-grained control of the node's network capacities.</br>- The graph in the UI's traffic monitor has been significantly improved by keeping track of the traffic we see in the background and then rendering it on demand, at any desired scale.</br>- A new RPC method, `rescan`, has been added to allow node operators to rescan the chain for wallet transactions from a certain height. This can help speed up the rescan process for keys that are known to be generated after a certain date or block height.</br>- A new endpoint has been added to the REST server to find the current best known block at a certain height, without having to do RPC calls. This is useful for service implementations that need to track or query blocks.</br></br>### Translation updates</br></br>- Bulgarian</br>- Dutch</br>- French</br>- Italian</br>- Korean</br>- Persian</br>- Portuguese (pt_PT)</br>- Tamil</br></br>### RPC API Changes</br></br>- The `verifychain` RPC command no longer accepts negative values</br>- `addnode` will now return error -32 when the address provided is too long</br>- `getpeerinfo` provides 2 new fields per peer, `addr_processed` and `addr_rate_limited`</br></br>### Dependency updates</br></br>- Updated `zlib` to 1.2.12.</br>- Updated `libevent` to 2.1.12-stable.</br>- Update the LevelDB subtree to use the same version as Bitcoin 22.0, from the [bitcoin-core maintained fork](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/leveldb-subtree).</br></td>

      <td>This is a major release, containing over 300 PRs. Our original intention was to release 1.11 with path-based storage, but eventually we decided it was time to make the release without waiting for PBSS to be merged, so we can get back to a steady release schedule.</br></br>We hope to soon follow up the 1.11 release with 1.12, including PBSS.</br></br>### Shanghai Upgrade Support</br></br>Most of the code for the [Shanghai fork][shanghai] is merged into 1.11, but activation of the fork is not configured. The Shanghai protocol upgrade will contain the ability to make withdrawals from the consensus-layer (beacon chain). Withdrawals are specified in [EIP-4895: Beacon chain push withdrawals as operations](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4895).</br></br>Other features included are [EIP-3855: PUSH0 instruction](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3855), [EIP-3860: Limit and meter initcode](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3860) and [EIP-3651: Warm COINBASE](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3651).</br></br>[shanghai]: https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs/blob/master/network-upgrades/mainnet-upgrades/shanghai.md</br></br>### A New Database Backend</br></br>[`Pebble`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/pebble/) was added as a database backend to replace good old [`LevelDB`](https://github.com/syndtr/goleveldb).</br></br>LevelDB has served us very well over the years, alas, it is a one-person project where the maintainer has signaled that the project is not a priority. We have been forced to consider three options:</br></br>1. Stick with goleveldb as long as we can, don't worry about it,</br>2. Fork goleveldb (or some other database), and maintain it ourselves.</br>3. Pick a different database, actively maintained by a dedicated team.</br></br>Since option one is not really a long-term solution, the choice was between two and three. Maintaining a database is a huge effort, and is not a burden we want to carry. Hence, we have been aiming for option 3, and eventually settled on Pebble.</br></br>Pebble is actively maintained by a dedicated team, and is used by other projects. We hope that this is a good long-term bet. It has performed well in our benchmark tests, we are very interested in getting feedback from actual production systems. In order to use `pebble`,</br></br>- You need to be on a 64-bit system,</br>- You also need to resync from scratch (with or without ancients) -- there is no migration functionality,</br>- And you need to specify `--db.engine=pebble` initially. For subsequent runs, geth should discover `pebble` automatically.</br></br>### Removed Features</br></br>We have removed support for the `ropsten` and `kiln` test networks. We have also removed libraries for mobile development and the `puppeth` tool.</br></br>The `personal` RPC namespace is now deprecated. In order to interact with `personal` APIs, you need to specifically allow it via the `--rpc.enabledeprecatedpersonal` command-line flag.</br></br>Support for certain legacy files configuration files was dropped. `geth` now will ignore these datadir files:</br></br>- `static-nodes.json`</br>- `trusted-nodes.json`</br></br>If any these are found, an error will be printed to the log. Setups using such files should use to the [TOML configuration-file][tomlfile] instead.</br></br>[tomlfile]: https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/fundamentals/config-files</br></br>### Backwards-Incompatible Changes</br></br>When using geth for mining or as a clique sealer, the `--miner.etherbase` flag now has to be be set explicitly. Previously, Geth would use the 'first' local account as etherbase automatically, but this possibility has been removed in Geth 1.11.</br></br>This change does not affect proof-of-stake networks because the fee recipient address is provided by the consenus-layer and not configured in Geth anymore.</br></br>Geth's JSON-RPC server has become more strict; the `JSON-RPC` spec requires the version field to be exactly `"jsonrpc": "2.0"`. This is now verified by the server -- a change which is not backwards-compatible with non-conforming client implementations.</br></br>If you are building from source, go-ethereum now requires Go version `1.18` or later ([#26160](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/26160)).</br></br>### New Features</br></br>[#26149](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/26149) added an option to direct log output to a file. This feature has been requested a lot. It's sometimes useful to have this available when running geth in an environment that doesn't easily allow redirecting the output.</br></br>We have added a method `debug_setTrieFlushInterval` to make it possible to set the trie flush interval via RPC ([#24785](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24785)). Essentially, this makes it possible to configure the node to be more or less "archive:ish", and without restarting the node while reconfiguring it.</br></br>Geth can now set custom HTTP headers, in particular for two scenarios:</br></br>- `geth attach`</br>- `geth` commands which can use `--remotedb`, e.g `geth db inspect`</br></br>The ability to use custom headers is typically useful for connecting to cloud-apis, e.g. providing an infura- or alchemy key, or for that matter access-keys for environments behind cloudflare.</br></br>#### Tracing</br></br>For tracing, it is sometimes desirable to capture logs triggered by a trace, when using the `callTracer`. For example: call `USDT.transfer` will trigger a `Transfer(from, to, value)` event. By specifying `{"withLog": true}`, these events will be collected. Some bugs related to tracing and `gasUsed` was fixed.</br></br> For `prestateTracer`, the result will from now on omit empty fields instead of including a zero value (e.g. no more `balance: '0x'`). The prestateTracer now takes an option `diffMode: bool`. In this mode the tracer will output the pre state and post data for the modified parts of state.</br></br>[#26241](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/26241) should make it easier to sign EIP-712 typed data via the accounts.Wallet API, by using the mimetype for typed data.</br></br>It is now possible to get the result for multiple tracers in one go via the `muxTracer`.</br></br>#### Filter System</br></br>Via the filter subscriptions to `newPendingTransactions`, one can now subscribe to the _full_ pending transactions, as opposed to just being notified about hashes.</br></br>The keywords `safe` and `finalized` can now also be used as block range specifiers when requesting logs.</br></br>## All Changes</br></br>### Larger changes</br></br>- Added `pebble` as a new database backend.

      <td>Litecoin Core v0.21.2.1 Release</br>==============</br></br>Follow our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/litecoinproject) for the latest dev news.</br></br>We are pleased to release Litecoin Core 0.21.2.1. This is a new minor version release, including a critical bug fix introduced in the previous release. It is recommended for all users to upgrade to this version.</br></br>Notable changes</br>===============</br></br>An issue with MWEB key generation for older wallets that were upgraded was solved. Keys are now generated from the appropriate keypools, and coins sent to previously generated stealth addresses are recoverable. Use rescanblockchain after upgrading to recover any missing MWEB coins.</br></br>Download Binaries</br>===============</br></br>To download, please visit the download page [here](https://litecoin.org/). Alternatively, you can view the download folder [here](https://download.litecoin.org/litecoin-0.21.2.1/).</br></br>Please use GPG to verify the integrity of the release binaries. This ensures that the binary you have downloaded has not been tampered with. Linux, MacOS and Win32 cygwin command line GPG instructions are available [here](https://download.litecoin.org/README-HOWTO-GPG-VERIFY-TEAM-MEMBERS-KEY.txt). Please also note that we GPG sign the binaries as a convenience to you, the ultimate way to verify the integrity of the builds is to build them yourself using Gitian. Instructions on how to perform these builds, can be found [here](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/blob/master/doc/gitian-building.md).</br></br>For this release, the binaries have been signed with key identifier [0x3620e9d387e55666 ](https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;search=0x3620E9D387E55666)(davidburkett38’s key).</br></br>WARNING</br>=======</br></br>Despite this version being heavily tested, this version may still contain bugs.

      <td>Version 1.9.4 of `rippled`, the reference implementation of the XRP Ledger protocol is now available. This release introduces an amendment that removes the ability for an NFT issuer to indicate that trust lines should be automatically created for royalty payments from secondary sales of NFTs, in response to a bug report that indicated how this functionality could be abused to mount a denial of service attack against the issuer.</br></br>## Action Required</br></br>This release introduces a new amendment to the XRP Ledger protocol, **`fixRemoveNFTokenAutoTrustLine`** to mitigate a potential denial-of-service attack against NFT issuers that minted NFTs and allowed secondary trading of those NFTs to create trust lines for any asset.</br></br>This amendment is open for voting according to the XRP Ledger's [amendment process](https://xrpl.org/amendments.html), which enables protocol changes following two weeks of &gt;80% support from trusted validators.</br></br>If you operate an XRP Ledger server, then you should upgrade to version 1.9.4 within two weeks, to ensure service continuity. The exact time that protocol changes take effect depends on the voting decisions of the decentralized network.</br></br>For more information about NFTs on the XRP Ledger, see [NFT Conceptual Overview](https://xrpl.org/nft-conceptual-overview.html).</br></br></br>## Install / Upgrade</br></br>On supported platforms, see the [instructions on installing or updating `rippled`](https://xrpl.org/install-rippled.html).</br></br>## Changelog</br></br>## Contributions</br></br>The primary change in this release is the following bug fix:</br></br>- **Introduce fixRemoveNFTokenAutoTrustLine amendment**: Introduces the `fixRemoveNFTokenAutoTrustLine` amendment, which disables the `tfTrustLine` flag, which a malicious attacker could exploit to mount denial-of-service attacks against NFT issuers that specified the flag on their NFTs.

      <td># Release Notes for Bitcoin Cash Node version 26.0.0</br></br>Bitcoin Cash Node version 26.0.0 is now available from:</br></br>  &lt;https://bitcoincashnode.org&gt;</br></br>## Overview</br></br>This release of Bitcoin Cash Node (BCHN) is marked as a major release but not due to consensus changes - only because it changes an interface (the rpcbind / rpcallowip options) in a way that is not completely backward compatible, and therefore needs to be tagged as a major version in accordance with Semantic Versioning.</br></br>However, for practical purposes, this version is more like a minor release, containing corrections and improvements such as:</br></br>- RPC related bug fixes and output improvements</br>- Performance optimization for getblock</br>- A new benchmark performance bisection script</br>- Some support code for future UTXO commitments</br>- Minor documentation updates</br></br>Users who are running any of our previous releases (24.x.y or 25.0.0) are encouraged to upgrade to v26.0.0.</br></br>## Usage recommendations</br></br>If you have been using the `rpcallowip` or `rpcbind` options, please see the 'Modified functionality' subsection of this document to take</br>changes into account in your configuration.</br></br>## Network changes</br></br>A few RPC calls have been modified to support additional output fields.</br></br>## Added functionality</br></br>A new verbosity level (3) has been added to `getblock` RPC command. It is like level 2 but each transaction will include inputs' `prevout`</br>information.  The existing `/rest/block/` REST endpoint is modified to contain this information too. Every `vin` field will contain an additional `prevout` subfield describing the spent output. `prevout` contains the following keys:</br></br>- `generated` - true if the spent coin was a coinbase</br>- `height`</br>- `value`</br>- `scriptPubKey`</br>- `tokenData` (after May 2023 upgrade, appears if the transaction input had token data)</br></br>## Deprecated functionality</br></br>None.</br></br>## Modified functionality</br></br>- The `rpcallowip` option can no longer be used to automatically listen on all network interfaces. Instead, the `rpcbind` parameter must be used to specify the IP addresses to listen on. Listening for RPC commands over a public network connection is insecure and should be disabled, so a warning is now printed if a user selects such a configuration. If you need to expose RPC in order to use a tool like Docker, ensure you only bind RPC to your localhost, e.g. `docker run [...] -p 127.0.0.1:8332:8332` (this is an extra :8332 over the normal Docker port specification).</br></br>- The `getblock` RPC command has been modified: verbosity level 2 now returns `fee` information per transaction in the block.</br></br>- The `getblock` RPC command with verbosity level 0 now takes a faster path when returning raw block data to clients. It now skips some sanity checks, and assumes the block data read from disk is valid. Clients that read this serialized block data via this RPC call should be aware that it is not as stictly checked as it was previous to this release, and that it's now possible (in theory at least) to retrieve a corrupted block via the RPC interface.</br>  In practice, it's almost always the case that blocks are not corrupt on-disk and this changed guarantee yields significant performance improvements for RPC clients retrieving raw block data. Node admins can disable this new fast-path behavior by using the `-checkblockreads=1` configuration option, which will enable extra consistency checks for raw block reads via RPC.</br></br></br>## Removed functionality</br></br>None.</br></br>## New RPC methods</br></br>None.</br></br>## User interface changes</br></br>The semantics of the `rpcallowip` option have changed - see 'Modified functionality' subsection above.</br></br>## Regressions</br></br>Bitcoin Cash Node 26.0.0 does not introduce any known regressions as compared to 25.0.0.</br></br>## Limitations</br></br>Nothing new to report.</br></br>## Known Issues</br></br>Some issues could not be closed in time for release, but we are tracking all of them on our GitLab repository.</br></br>- The minimum macOS version is 10.14 (Mojave). Earlier macOS versions are no longer supported.</br></br>- Windows users are recommended not to run multiple instances of bitcoin-qt or bitcoind on the same machine if the wallet feature is enabled. There is risk of data corruption if instances are configured to use the same wallet folder.</br></br>- Some users have encountered unit tests failures when running in WSL environments (e.g. WSL/Ubuntu).  At this time, WSL is not considered a supported environment for the software. This may change in future.</br></br>  The functional failure on WSL is tracked in [Issue #33](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/33). It arises when competing node program instances are not prevented from opening the same wallet folder. Running multiple program instances with the same configured walletdir could potentially lead to data corruption. The failure has not been observed on other operating systems so far.</br></br>- `doc/dependencies.md` needs revision [(Issue #65)](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/65).</br></br>- For users running from sources built with BerkeleyDB releases newer than the 5.3 which is used in this release, please take into consideration the database format compatibility issues described in [Issue #34](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/34).  When building from source it is recommended to use BerkeleyDB 5.3 as this avoids wallet database incompatibility issues with the official release.</br></br>- The `test_bitcoin-qt` test executable fails on Linux Mint 20 (see [Issue #144](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/144)). This does not otherwise appear to impact the functioning of the BCHN software on that platform.</br></br>- With a certain combination of build flags that included disabling the QR code library, a build failure was observed where an erroneous</br>  linking against the QR code library (not present) was attempted ([Issue #138](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/138)).</br></br>- Possible out-of-memory error when starting bitcoind with high excessiveblocksize value ([Issue #156](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/156))</br></br>- A problem was observed on scalenet where nodes would sometimes hang for around 10 minutes, accepting RPC connections but not responding to them (see [#210](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/210)).</br></br>- At the time of writing, scalenet has not been mined for a while (since 10 August 2022), thus synchronization will stop at that block time. This isn't considered a BCHN issue per se, it depends on miners to resume mining this testnet.</br></br>- Startup and shutdown time of nodes on scalenet can be long (see [Issue #313](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/313)).</br></br>- Race condition in one of the `p2p_invalid_messages.py` tests (see [Issue #409](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/409)).</br></br>- Occasional failure in bchn-txbroadcastinterval.py (see [Issue #403](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/403)).</br></br>- wallet_keypool.py test failure when run as part of suite on certain many-core platforms (see [Issue #380](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/380)).</br></br>- Spurious 'insufficient funds' failure during p2p_stresstest.py benchmark (see [Issue #377](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/377)).</br></br>- If compiling from source, secp256k1 now no longer works with latest openssl3.x series. There are workarounds (see [Issue #364](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/364)).</br></br>- Spurious `AssertionError: Mempool sync timed out` in several tests (see [Issue #357](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/357)).</br></br>- For some platforms, there may be a need to install additional libraries in order to build from source (see [Issue #431](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/431) and discussion in MR 1523).</br></br>- More TorV3 static seeds may be needed to get `-onlynet=onion` working (see [Issue #429](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/429)).</br></br>- Memory usage can be very high if repeatedly doing RPC `getblock` with verbose=2 on a hash of known big blocks (see [Issue #466](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/466)).</br></br>---</br></br>## Changes since Bitcoin Cash Node 25.0.0</br></br>### New documents</br></br>None.</br></br>### Removed documents</br></br>None.</br></br>### Notable commits grouped by functionality</br></br>#### Security or consensus relevant fixes</br></br>The semantic changes to `rpcallowip` have been made in consideration of increased node security, as listening for RPC commands on public network interfaces is insecure and should be disabled. See the 'Modified functionality' section above for details.</br></br>#### Interfaces / RPC</br></br>- 1592a894a0dc0e7fb318c795babda03e7f3b95ff Don't log on success by default in ReadRawBlockFromDisk with `-checkblockreads=1`</br>- 751bb58b60e4355ef825bc9106e12454c5b1d2b1 Fix getblockstats feerate unit in the RPC command help</br>- 931fe7280dc48273fda3dc1540f0ba605e0f1519 Nit: Some formatting nits in rpc/rawtransaction.cpp, `getrawtransaction`</br>- b8c237ad0750f403efc2ae948a329732f333170e rpc: Add level 3 verbosity to `getblock` RPC call; Add `fee` to level 2</br>- cf7e12ce889786a5f9e3ca5a2a01683339efc1a6 Improvements to `getrawtransaction` with verbosity=2</br>- eb0b086aea2ec26ca9257eb4598a2702d6a94bac Nit: More nits for getrawtransaction in rpc/rawtransaction.cpp</br></br>#### Features in internal development: support for UTXO commitments</br></br>- 718e29e80e3ec96b17fa4dc5b00c05c82de8e202 Added new functions to secp256k1 for serializing the pubkey from a multiset</br>- ebc2a168bde73a0f1bf33efa5c90d808e70ccd64 Modify the generic code in `hash.h` to support alternate hashers</br>- eeab3ac8e7813e799898fe7bd847f16483111d34 Added C++ wrapper for EC multiset, plus tests</br></br>### Data directory changes</br></br>None.</br></br>#### Performance optimizations</br></br>- 4c30a7fcb6d9e0d042773eb3aaba89d16f595d34 RPC: Read block data directly from disk in `getblock verbosity=0`</br>- 7ae7d42f9452323c8235570b98e144ac4e7abe6c Remove spurious lock</br>- 8ba475f4c6a2e800859b52b4fe2446ebcfcf6ec3 Update chainparamsconstants.h for version v26.0.0</br>- e1d39e5c4d143a3561e8fbd1fe9fb64f8d567ff8 Update checkpoints for v26.0.0 (main, test, test4, and chip)</br></br>#### GUI</br></br>None.</br></br>#### Code quality</br></br>- 3be863dee2f06b556fbe53782a1b9051f73d6ad3 Some NITs (follow-up to MR 1600)</br>- 5379d1c67445c7f3e1f2c2a90af3183c3c7c55dc Minor nit: Fixed a typo and a formatting error in span.h</br>- 85728782f77b0eebd13f57e770bc975da89c084a Nit: Use CURRENCY_UNIT in `getblockstats` help rather than BCH</br>- 8757d2ae1413615c4911af235b978f24443b1e7e Fix bug: RPC &amp; REST API sometimes reads from ::ChainActive() without locks</br>- 8dc6789e7a5c95543ae25ae57ec215529c075b00 httpserver: Address review comments from !1429</br>- 9b5d13cb5aec78a5240b6befbf17816dd88b423a Add additional sanity checks and a unit test for ReadRawBlockFromDisk()</br>- a37951a013368c59690acc8a48799911f2c3d6df Fix bug where `getrawtransaction` with verbose=2 on a coinbase txn fails</br></br>#### Documentation updates</br></br>- 4f1ed0d6858a918c37b9c6a19dc96eaa6abc3912 [doc] Update the release version for signature verification instructions</br>- d0308cef252ecfd3bfaad55b91b7f0ab2bc56ea6 Add rpcthreads to example file.</br></br>#### Build / general</br></br>- 00202a246716ff50ca2acbfcecc700500e444f3d build: Check for dependency 'help2man'</br></br>#### Build / Linux</br></br>- 9b6d19c67bbfee46e261777d1c92bedeac7b4228 Fix breaking `ninja check-lint` on my system after latest flake8</br></br>#### Build / Windows</br></br>None.</br></br>#### Build / MacOSX</br></br>None.</br></br>#### Tests / test framework</br></br>- 24479388842befdc54751d4eb8b00e1ad91150fd Fix for rpc_blockchain.py intermittent failure.</br>- 4355d67db96fcef6a46cc5f79dda30081405081d Fix potential UB in wallet test fixture</br>- 48d8116976cbdf3898187fb39c1bb3d82b634a13 Prevent theoretical UB for CConnMan and PeerLogicValidation mis-use in tests</br>- 5256867daae1277108fafd7b629490b80405c504 [fuzz] Avoid double and triple copying of data when running fuzzers</br>- d7273ec070786b2eadbde50dad77a2b86be5c890 Tests for C++20 work-alike Span</br>- f3e488a853f3c02e45c6eb494c213bfab5e44537 Temporarily disable payment server tests which fail due to expired certificate</br></br>#### Benchmarks</br></br>- 61413d0c6162e7293b5467cb07cddd94762cc03c Benchmark bisect script improvements</br></br>#### Seeds / seeder software</br></br>- 88f1ac6f45860aa1cc44e3862466acdb0778318c Update regex in makeseeds.py to accept BCHN v26.x.x</br>- e8a8d5f1a71924b767bdbdd2b1e6f93f0d4fa8d0 Updated seeds for mainnet for v26.0.0</br></br>#### Maintainer tools</br></br>None.</br></br>#### Infrastructure</br></br>None.</br></br>#### Cleanup</br></br>None.</br></br>#### Continuous Integration (GitLab CI)</br></br>- 25bdba4f4732b118af86b3719c3665244f632398 [ci] Add sanitizer job for undefined behavior</br></br>#### Backports</br></br>- 44830d4cc984aa39d9fe4fc05df51d991deb7d15 [backport] net: Always default rpcbind to localhost, never "all interfaces"</br>- 50b7cb4fe3c242a5c147ca8a858ee758023c3483 [backport] tests: Modify rpc_bind to conform to #14532 behaviour.</br>- af4a29dd844f7347fa77bd70e9e9587542d5f083 [backport] CNetAddr: Add IsBindAny method to check for INADDR_ANY</br>- e07f97db146e61bbc8a8ab018cd09c6b73e86494 [backport] rpcbind: Warn about exposing RPC to untrusted networks</br>- 14cab1395fc845c2b3f2c654e5a4f18958dc16df [backport] net: fix use-after-free in tests</br></td>
