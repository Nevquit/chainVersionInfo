      <td>&lt;!-- Eezo-Inlaid Circuitry (v1.17.0) --&gt;</br></br>This is a feature release, with all accumulated development from the last 3 months. See below for the highlights.</br></br>Note that this release contains multiple critical security fixes, as well as many bug fixes, and is recommended for all users. However, if you are cautious about upgrades, you can also install v1.16.9 which has just the critical security fixes. Specifically, this release fixes [CVE-2026-26313](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/security/advisories/GHSA-689v-6xwf-5jf3), [CVE-2026-26314](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/security/advisories/GHSA-2gjw-fg97-vg3r), [CVE-2026-26315](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/security/advisories/GHSA-m6j8-rg6r-7mv8). </br></br>We recommend recreating your p2p node key after installing this update, which you can do by removing the `DATADIR/geth/nodekey` file before restarting geth. Note this will cause a change in the p2p node ID, which may break static peering setups.</br></br>## Highlights</br></br>### Path-based Archive Node with Proofs</br></br>The path-based archive node can now serve proofs (via `eth_getProof`) for the state of older blocks.</br></br>You can configure the block range that supports proving independently from other archive state availability. Specifically, you can use the `--history.trienode` command-line flag to set the amount of blocks for which tree nodes will be tracked.</br></br>This feature is disabled by default. Note that state history cannot easily be recovered once deleted, as it can only be generated by processing blocks. However, you can enable trienode history (and/or state history) at any time to turn a full node into a partial archive node, keeping state from that point in time onwards.</br></br>#32727, #32621, #33551, #32981, #33399, #32913, #33303, #33584, #33329, #33681, #33103, #33098, #33515, #32247</br></br>### EraE History Support</br></br>Geth now suports the [EraE](https://github.com/eth-clients/e2store-format-specs/pull/16) file format, an archival format for post-merge chain history.</br></br>#32157, #33827</br></br>### OpenTelemetry Tracing</br></br>OpenTelemetry tracing is now supported by the RPC server, including support for distributed tracing.</br>We have also added some tracing spans for block processing via the engine API, i.e. `engine_newPayload`.</br></br>#33599, #33452, #33780, #33521</br></br>## All Changes</br></br>### Geth CLI</br></br>- The `geth version-check` subcommand has been removed. This command checked the geth website for signed vulnerability notices, and would tell if updates are necessary  (#33498)</br>- There is now a `--miner.maxblobs` command-line flag to set a limit on blobs included in built blocks (#33129, #33302)</br>- Geth now supports continuous profiling with Grafana Pyroscope (#33623)</br>- A rare bug that could halt block production in `geth --dev` mode was fixed (#33146)</br>- A new `--rpc.rangelimit` flag configures the maximum block range for `eth_getLogs` (#33163)</br>- `geth --exitwhensynced` will now set the `finalized` and `safe` block (#33038)</br>- `geth --ethstats` now reports the newPayload processing time to the stats server (#33395)</br>- A lot of minor issues in Geth's command-line flag processing have been fixed (#33379, #33338, #33330, #32999, #33279, #33252)</br>- The `evm blocktest` command can now read filenames from stdin when no path is provided (#32824)</br></br>### Fork Implementation</br></br>- EIP-8024: Backward compatible SWAPN, DUPN, EXCHANGE (#33095, #33787, #33614, #33361)</br>- We have implemented engine_getBlobsV3 (#33404, #33444)</br>- The engine API now rejects calls with wrong payload version (#32754, #33322)</br>- blsync has been updated for Fusaka (#33349, #33272, #33065, #32674)</br>- Some work towards the migration of state to a binary tree has landed, and this replaces the Verkle Tree implementation (#33807, #33739, #33694, #32445, #33461)</br>- Some access list semantics have been fixed while working on EIP-7928 Block-Level Access Lists (#33281, #33637, #33450)</br></br>### Core</br></br>- The crypto/ecies library allowed extraction of the private key used for key derivation via observation of response timing. We recommend rotating the node key after applying this update. (#33669)</br>- When a missing block is encountered during tx unindexing, Geth will now skip it and move on instead of entering an infinite loop. (#33573)</br>- Geth now optionally collect and export metrics about the total state size (#33254, #33376, #33415)</br>- There is a new `OnStateUpdate` hook, which is called after all state of a block has been committed. This gives access to the changeset of the block. (#33490)</br>- Some minor tracing bugs have been fixed (#32919, #33148, #33644, #33214)</br>- Various minor issues in the freezer database have also been fixed (#33747, #33025, #33203, #33344)</br>- The `setHead` operation now unsets the finalized block, in cases where the rolled-back block range extends before it. (#33486)</br>- The `SignatureValues` method of `types.Signer` now reports an error for invalid signature sizes (#33647)</br>- Geth prints detailed log messages for 'slow blocks' (#33655, #33525, #33442, #32812, #33659, #33532)</br>- Pebble configuration has been tweaked for improved performance (#33697, #33353, #33315)</br>- A rare crash in the log indexer related to reorg handling has been fixed (#33810)</br>- Internal state diff size accounting has been corrected, so state diffs will now be flushed to the disk store less often (#33505)</br>- Since the keccak256 hash function variant used by Ethereum no longer has a fast-path in the standard library, we have vendored the keccak implementation back into our repository (#33323)</br></br>### Library</br></br>- The RLP library now has a RawList type for dealing with un-decoded lists in a more convenient way (#33755, #33834, #33840, #33841)</br>- The low-level RLP iterator and uses of it have been improved (#33245, #33188, #33820)</br>- Clef can now sign blob transactions with cell proofs (#32910)</br>- Fixed some corner-case bugs in metrics exporting (#33749, #33748)</br>- The hardware wallet library now supports the Ledger Nano Gen5 and correctly enables EIP-712 signing for all supported versions. (#33297, #33113)</br>- `SignTextWithPassphrase` now works correctly with all supported hardware wallets (#33138)</br>- Some minor bugs were fixed in the keystore implementation (#33606, #33602, #33090)</br>- The `bitutil.XORBytes` function has been deprecated in favor of stdlib package crypto/subtle (#33331)</br>- A memory leak in the beacon chain light client was fixed (#33483)</br></br>### RPC</br></br>- `eth_getTransactionByHash` now returns the `blockTimestamp` as part of the transaction object (#33709)</br>- Error codes for some conditions in `eth_simulateV1`, `eth_getLogs`, `eth_getStorageAt` have been improved to better comply with the execution RPC spec (#33007, #33320, #33282)</br>- `eth_simulateV1` now selects the correct set of precompiles for the simulated header (#33363)</br>- `eth_sendTransaction` and `eth_fillTransaction` now default to EIP-1559 (#33058)</br>- The GraphQL implementation has received some bug fixes for cases where a resolved item is not found. (#33184, #33225)</br>- In GraphQL, the `gasPrice` is now retrievable for transaction types 0x3 and 0x4 (#33542)</br>- The RPC server now enables plain-text HTTP2 for improved performance (#33812)</br>- The RPC client no longer sends spurious RST_STREAM HTTP2 frames (#33122)</br>- Some minor JSON encoding bugs have been fixed in `ethclient` (#33693, #33242, #33464)</br>- The `gethclient` has a new wrapper of the `callTracer` (#31510)</br>- In the `callTracer`, reported logs now contain an `index` field which is the index of the log within the transaction (#33629)</br></br>### P2P Networking</br></br>- The transaction pool heartbeat mechanism had some fixes for potential resource leaks (#33704)</br>- The eth and snap protocol implementations nows validates most p2p messages before decoding their content. This improves security and sync performance in some cases. (#33835)</br>- The blob transaction pool has seen some bug fixes and now accepts nonce-gapped transactions to a very limited extent (#32717, #33775, #33474, #33352, #33301, #33260)</br>- Snap sync status is now tracked better, ensuring a snap sync will not be triggered accidentally by the engine API (#33157)</br>- The snap sync scheduler was improved to better protect the trie database against accidential mutations while the node is processing blocks. This resolves some edge cases where the database could be corrupted (#33428)</br>- The header sync implementation was fixed to better deal with `setHead` operations during sync (#33481)</br>- Peer connections delivering stale transactions will be penalized less, since delivery of a few stale transactions is a common occurrence. (#32725)</br>- Peers announcing transactions of one type, and delivering a different type, are now disconnected as penalty (#33378)</br>- Similarly, peers delivering invalid KZG proofs will now be disconnected (5b99d2bba4)</br>- The transaction pool has new metrics for the number of accounts with transactions (#33646, #33654)</br></br>For a full rundown of the changes please consult the Geth [1.17.0](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/milestone/197?closed=1) release milestone.</br></br>---</br></br>As with all our previous releases, you can find the:</br></br>- Pre-built binaries for all platforms on our [downloads page](https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/).</br>- Docker images published under [`ethereum/client-go`](https://hub.docker.com/r/ethereum/client-go) (use "stable" tag).</br>- Ubuntu packages in our [Launchpad PPA repository](https://launchpad.net/~ethereum/+archive/ubuntu/ethereum).</br>- macOS packages in our [Homebrew Tap repository](https://github.com/ethereum/homebrew-ethereum).</br></td>

      <td># Release Notes for Bitcoin Cash Node version 29.0.0</br></br>Bitcoin Cash Node version 29.0.0 is now available from:</br></br>  &lt;https://bitcoincashnode.org&gt;</br></br>## Overview</br></br>This is a major release of Bitcoin Cash Node (BCHN) that implements the May 15, 2026 Network Upgrade. The upgrade</br>implements the following four consensus-level CHIP upgrades:</br></br>- [CHIP-2024-12 P2S: Pay to Script](https://github.com/bitjson/bch-p2s)</br>- [CHIP-2021-05-loops: Bounded Looping Operations](https://github.com/bitjson/bch-loops)</br>- [CHIP-2025-05 Functions: Function Definition and Invocation Operations](https://github.com/bitjson/bch-functions)</br>- [CHIP-2025-05 Bitwise: Re-Enable Bitwise Operations](https://github.com/bitjson/bch-bitwise)</br></br>Additionally, this version contains various other performance fixes, corrections, and improvements.</br></br>Users who are running any of our previous releases (v28.x.x or before) are urged to upgrade to v29.0.0 ahead of</br>May 15, 2026.</br></br>## Usage recommendations</br></br>Users who are running v28.0.1 or older are urged to upgrade to v29.0.0 in order to maintain compatibility with the</br>network.</br></br>## Network changes</br></br>- It's now possible to limit total bandwidth usage of the peer-to-peer network, on a per-peer basis. The CLI &amp; conf</br>  argument `-peerratelimit` has been added for this purpose. See the built-in help (`bitcoind --help`) for more information.</br>- Optimizations were made to aspects of the network layer, reducing CPU utilization in high-txn rate scenarios.</br></br>## Added functionality</br></br>- A new "coin stats" index has been added, which may be enabled with the command-line option `-coinstatsindex`</br>  (default: disabled). If enabled, this index keeps track of various UTXO-set releated statistics for each block, which</br>  can be queried with the `gettxoutsetinfo` RPC.</br>- A new `patterns` flag has been added to the `getblock` and `getrawtransaction` RPC methods.</br>  - This is usable with all verbose outputs (&gt;=2 for `getblock`, &gt;=1 for `getrawtransaction`), and if set then all input</br>    and output scripts contain an additional key, `byteCodePattern` which is a JSON object that describes the script's</br>    pattern and "fingerprint". This is useful for categorizing the script in question. For more information on what is</br>    inside this key's object, see the RPC help for `getblock` and `getrawtransaction`, and [this discussion on Bitcoin Cash Research](https://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/smart-contract-fingerprinting-a-method-for-pattern-recognition-and-analysis-in-bitcoin-cash/1441).</br>  - If used with verbosity levels that include prevouts (`getblock` verbosity&gt;=3 and `getrawtransaction` verbosity==2)</br>    and if the input is spending a P2SH prevout, then additionally there will a `redeemScript` object having its own `byteCodePattern`</br>    and additionally having a `p2shType` key.</br>  - A REST endpoint `/block/withpatterns/&lt;HASH&gt;` has been added which corresponds to `getblock` RPC with `verbosity=3 patterns=true`.</br>  - A REST endpoint `/tx/withpatterns/&lt;HASH&gt;` has been added which corresponds to `/tx/` with patterns added.</br>- Two new keys have been added to the results dictionary of the `getmempoolinfo` RPC method:</br>  - `permitbaremultisig` (true or false) indicates the node's `-permitbaremultisig` app-global setting.</br>  - `maxdatacarriersize` (numeric) indicates the node's `-datacarriersize=&lt;n&gt;` app-global setting.</br>- A new CLI argument `-peerratelimit` has been added, in order to optionally limit per-peer data transfer usage. This</br>  facility is off by default. See the built-in help for more information (`bitcoind --help`).</br></br>## Deprecated functionality</br></br>None</br></br>## Modified functionality</br></br>- The `gettxoutsetinfo` RPC has been modified and expanded greatly. Please see the RPC help for `gettxoutsetinfo` for</br>  full details but below is a summary of changes:</br>  - By default it now uses a new hashing algorithm, `hash_serialized_3` which is a better and more platform-neutral</br>    mechanism for hashing the current UTXO set.</br>  - Support for EC Multiset Hash (ECMH) as well as Core-compatbile MuHash3072 has been added to the RPC as well.</br>  - This RPC can now interoperate with the `coinstatsindex`. If enabled, the index allows `gettxoutsetinfo` to query</br>    UTXO set statistics for any block in the block chain.</br>- The `getblockchaininfo` RPC now has a new key `upgrade_status` which contains details about the next scheduled BCH</br>  network upgrade and its activation. See the RPC help for `getblockchaininfo` for more details.</br>- Non-debug logging to disk (but not to console) is now rate-limited. Each non-debug log message has a quota of 1MiB per</br>  hour. (A non-debug message is any log message that would be printed even if `-debug=0` were specified on the command</br>  line.) If any non-debug log messages have been suppressed due to this mechanism during any 1-hour period, then all</br>  subsequent log messages during that period will be prefixed with a `[*]` to indicate that log message suppression is</br>  active and that the debug.log file is potentially incomplete. An exception to this quota rule are the "UpdateTip"</br>  messages which are seen when new blocks are added to the blockchain, which are never suppressed or rate-limited.</br>- RPCs that are used to generate transactions that allow for NFT "commitments" now allow for empty strings to represent</br>  empty NFT commitments. Previously, to express an empty commitment, one needed to omit the "commitment" key altogether</br>  from the JSON object specifying the NFT [Issue](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/538).</br></br>## Removed functionality</br></br>- The old hashing algorithm (`hash_serialized`) which was used by the `gettxoutsetinfo` algorithm has been removed</br>  in favor of a new algorithm `hash_serialized_3` which is used by default instead.</br>- Support for older macOS versions has been dropped. On Mac, the minimum supported version of macOS is macOS 13.3</br>  (Ventura) or newer.</br></br>## New RPC methods</br></br>None</br></br>## User interface changes</br></br>- By default, the `gettxoutsetinfo` now reports the UTXO set hash under the JSON object key `hash_serialized_3` rather</br>  than `hash_serialized`.</br>- For `getrawtransaction` at verbosity level 2, the JSON output now places the `sequence` field as the last</br>  object in the input, and the `fee` field as the first object after the `vout` array. This aligns with the unified</br>  transaction serialization used by `getblock`. The data content is unchanged, but clients relying on specific key</br>  ordering may need updates.</br>- The `getmempoolinfo` RPC now has two new keys: `permitbaremultisig` (boolean) and `maxdatacarriersize` (numeric).</br>- The `getblockchaininfo` RPC has a new key: `upgrade_status`, which itself is a dictionary with keys describing the</br>  upcoming network upgrade and when it will activate, or if it has already activated.</br></br>## Regressions</br></br>Bitcoin Cash Node 29.0.0 does not introduce any known regressions as compared to 28.0.1.</br></br>## Limitations</br></br>The following are limitations in this release of which users should be aware:</br></br>1. CashToken support is low-level at this stage. The wallet application does</br>   not yet keep track of the user's tokens.</br>   Tokens are only manageable via RPC commands currently.</br>   They only persist through the UTXO database and block database at this</br>   point.</br>   There are existing RPC commands to list and filter for tokens in the UTXO set.</br>   RPC raw transaction handling commands have been extended to allow creation</br>   (and sending) of token transactions.</br>   Interested users are advised to consult the functional test in</br>   `test/functional/bchn-rpc-tokens.py` for examples on token transaction</br>   construction and listing.</br>   Future releases will aim to extend the RPC API with more convenient</br>   ways to create and spend tokens, as well as upgrading the wallet storage</br>   and indexing subsystems to persistently store data about tokens of interest</br>   to the user. Later we expect to add GUI wallet management of Cash Tokens.</br></br>2. Transactions with SIGHASH_UTXO are not covered by DSProofs at present.</br></br>3. P2SH-32 is not used by default in the wallet (regular P2SH-20 remains</br>   the default wherever P2SH is treated).</br></br>4. The markup of Double Spend Proof events in the wallet does not survive</br>   a restart of the wallet, as the information is not persisted to the</br>   wallet.</br></br>5. The ABLA algorithm for BCH is currently temporarily set to cap the max block</br>   size at 2GB. This is due to limitations in the p2p protocol (as well as the</br>   block data file format in BCHN).</br></br></br>## Known Issues</br></br>Some issues could not be closed in time for release, but we are tracking all</br>of them on our GitLab repository.</br></br>- The minimum macOS version is 14.5 (Sonoma).</br>  Earlier macOS versions are no longer supported.</br></br>- Windows users are recommended not to run multiple instances of bitcoin-qt</br>  or bitcoind on the same machine if the wallet feature is enabled.</br>  There is risk of data corruption if instances are configured to use the same</br>  wallet folder.</br></br>- Some users have encountered unit tests failures when running in WSL</br>  environments (e.g. WSL/Ubuntu).  At this time, WSL is not considered a</br>  supported environment for the software. This may change in future.</br>  It has been reported that using WSL2 improves the issue.</br></br>- `doc/dependencies.md` needs revision [Issue](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/65).</br></br>- For users running from sources built with BerkeleyDB releases newer than</br>  the 5.3 which is used in this release, please take into consideration</br>  the database format compatibility issues described in [Issue](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/34).</br>  When building from source it is recommended to use BerkeleyDB 5.3 as this</br>  avoids wallet database incompatibility issues with the official release.</br></br>- The `test_bitcoin-qt` test executable fails on Linux Mint 20</br>  [Issue](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/144). This does not otherwise appear to impact the functioning</br>  of the BCHN software on that platform.</br></br>- With a certain combination of build flags that included disabling</br>  the QR code library, a build failure was observed where an erroneous</br>  linking against the QR code library (not present) was attempted [Issue](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/138).</br></br>- Possible out-of-memory error when starting bitcoind with high excessiveblocksize</br>  value [Issue](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/156)</br></br>- A problem was observed on scalenet where nodes would sometimes hang for</br>  around 10 minutes, accepting RPC connections but not responding to them</br>  [Issue](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/377).</br></br>- Startup and shutdown time of nodes on scalenet can be long [Issue](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/313).</br></br>- Race condition in one of the `p2p_invalid_messages.py` tests [Issue](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/409).</br></br>- Occasional failure in bchn-txbroadcastinterval.py [Issue](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/403).</br></br>- wallet_keypool.py test failure when run as part of suite on certain many-core</br>  platforms [Issue](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/380).</br></br>- Spurious 'insufficient funds' failure during p2p_stresstest.py benchmark</br>  [Issue](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/377).</br></br>- If compiling from source, secp256k1 now no longer works with latest openssl3.x series.</br>  There are workarounds [Issue](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/364).</br></br>- Spurious `AssertionError: Mempool sync timed out` in several tests</br>  [Issue](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/357).</br></br>- For some platforms, there may be a need to install additional libraries</br>  in order to build from source ([Issue](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/431) and discussion in MR 1523).</br></br>- More TorV3 static seeds may be needed to get `-onlynet=onion` working</br>  [Issue](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/429).</br></br>- Memory usage can be very high if repeatedly doing RPC `getblock` with</br>  verbose=2 on a hash of known big blocks [Issue](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/466).</br></br>- A GUI crash failure was observed when attempting to encrypt a large imported</br>  wallet [Issue](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/490).</br></br>- The 'wallet_multiwallet' functional test fails on latest Arch Linux due to</br>  a change in semantics in a dependency [Issue](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/505). This is not</br>  expected to impact functionality otherwise, only a particular edge case</br>  of the test.</br></br>- The 'p2p_extversion' functional test is sensitive to timing issues when</br>  run at high load [Issue](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/501).</br></br>---</br></br>## Changes since Bitcoin Cash Node 28.0.1</br></br>### New documents</br></br>None</br></br>### Removed documents</br></br>None</br></br>### Notable commits grouped by functionality</br></br>#### P2P Network</br></br>- ea755aa64812290c69684f2c699dcea547903a7a Added per-peer traffic limit rules, -peerratelimit</br>- 692527a80b3bbf91291039dbfdcbffef3722d117 [qa] Update mainnet static seeds in preparation for v29.0.0 release</br></br>#### Security or consensus relevant fixes</br></br>- e6a2445e5b3f5f70fdcf57785e0f944e277f6f42 Make CBlockIndex::nChainTx be a 64-bit unsigned int</br>- 724f9c9d6d39efc4a2a2190a5dfc82620184221d Post-upgrade 11: Add checkpoints to include post-upgrade blocks</br>- f759c6dc5294b64ed82a88618a109277826260b6 [backport] addrman, refactor: introduce user-defined type for internal nId</br>- b47c3c37c031dbf1c2c55f9977f1593fec0d5e63 Upgrade 11: Switch to height-based activation</br>- 7b9ebc2c68031aef346f90bb4fd658c7aa89c56a 2026 CHIPS: Bitops, Loops, Functions, and P2S</br>- 9c1e34e4828e19c10c90a2332c802984c90a7efd util: Filter control characters out of log messages</br>- 48c80b45c6d1634780556a153209ac45475a2ea7 log: Add rate limiting to LogPrintf</br>- 359dda2bdc76efcedec77f985cc4e74f4ace7504 Update checkpoints for v29.0.0 release</br>- f7db8343ec69ee18d4cfc795de1866fe59f574d8 [qa] Update "assume valid" and "minimum chain work" for v29.0.0 release</br></br>#### Interfaces / RPC</br></br>- be93a2d5b4251e8ad459ce3c2f331c4164c0d2b8 RPC: add verbosity=4 for `getblock` RPC, which adds script "byteCodePattern" information</br>- fe384182c160ced664585564eceec33017e4bb68 Add `coinstatsindex`, and use it with `gettxoutsetinfo` RPC;
