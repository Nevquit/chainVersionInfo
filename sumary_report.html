      <td>This is a new minor version release, including important security updates and changes to network efficiency.</br></br>**All Dogecoin Core users - miners, services, relay operators and wallet users - are strongly recommended to upgrade.**</br></br>A full description of all changes is available in the [release notes](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes.md)</br></br>### Security-related fixes</br></br>This release contains multiple security related fixes:</br></br>- The alert system has been removed and processing of alert messages has been disabled</br>- The transaction download system has been made more reliable</br>- The protocol implementation has been amended to reject buggy or malformed messages</br>- Memory management in events of high network traffic or when connected to extremely slow peers has been improved</br></br>### Fee Recommendation</br></br>This release changes the **recommended dust limit** for all participants on the Dogecoin network from 1 DOGE to **0.01 DOGE**. The full recommendation can be found [in the documentation](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/blob/1.14.6-dev/doc/fee-recommendation.md).</br></br>### Breaking changes</br></br>- The behavior of the `dumpwallet` and `backupwallet` RPC methods, to exclusively write to the directory specified by `-backupdir` and no longer overwrite files</br>- The maximum number of `addnode` records that a node will track has been limited to 800</br></br>### New features</br></br>- A new RPC method, `liststucktransactions` has been added to help wallet operators identify if any transactions are stuck (have not been mined and are not in the mempool) and enable resolution. This helps in cases where node-local fee or dust policies change, to prevent the node from sending out old transactions that got lost.</br>- Pruning configuration has been added to the UI, to make it easier to save diskspace for users of graphical (wallet) installations. </br>- A new RPC method, `setmaxconnections`, has been introduced that enables wallet and node operators to change the maximum number of connections their node allows without needing to restart allowing for more fine-grained control of the node's network capacities.</br>- The graph in the UI's traffic monitor has been significantly improved by keeping track of the traffic we see in the background and then rendering it on demand, at any desired scale.</br>- A new RPC method, `rescan`, has been added to allow node operators to rescan the chain for wallet transactions from a certain height. This can help speed up the rescan process for keys that are known to be generated after a certain date or block height.</br>- A new endpoint has been added to the REST server to find the current best known block at a certain height, without having to do RPC calls. This is useful for service implementations that need to track or query blocks.</br></br>### Translation updates</br></br>- Bulgarian</br>- Dutch</br>- French</br>- Italian</br>- Korean</br>- Persian</br>- Portuguese (pt_PT)</br>- Tamil</br></br>### RPC API Changes</br></br>- The `verifychain` RPC command no longer accepts negative values</br>- `addnode` will now return error -32 when the address provided is too long</br>- `getpeerinfo` provides 2 new fields per peer, `addr_processed` and `addr_rate_limited`</br></br>### Dependency updates</br></br>- Updated `zlib` to 1.2.12.</br>- Updated `libevent` to 2.1.12-stable.</br>- Update the LevelDB subtree to use the same version as Bitcoin 22.0, from the [bitcoin-core maintained fork](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/leveldb-subtree).</br></td>

      <td>Version 1.9.4 of `rippled`, the reference implementation of the XRP Ledger protocol is now available. This release introduces an amendment that removes the ability for an NFT issuer to indicate that trust lines should be automatically created for royalty payments from secondary sales of NFTs, in response to a bug report that indicated how this functionality could be abused to mount a denial of service attack against the issuer.</br></br>## Action Required</br></br>This release introduces a new amendment to the XRP Ledger protocol, **`fixRemoveNFTokenAutoTrustLine`** to mitigate a potential denial-of-service attack against NFT issuers that minted NFTs and allowed secondary trading of those NFTs to create trust lines for any asset.</br></br>This amendment is open for voting according to the XRP Ledger's [amendment process](https://xrpl.org/amendments.html), which enables protocol changes following two weeks of &gt;80% support from trusted validators.</br></br>If you operate an XRP Ledger server, then you should upgrade to version 1.9.4 within two weeks, to ensure service continuity. The exact time that protocol changes take effect depends on the voting decisions of the decentralized network.</br></br>For more information about NFTs on the XRP Ledger, see [NFT Conceptual Overview](https://xrpl.org/nft-conceptual-overview.html).</br></br></br>## Install / Upgrade</br></br>On supported platforms, see the [instructions on installing or updating `rippled`](https://xrpl.org/install-rippled.html).</br></br>## Changelog</br></br>## Contributions</br></br>The primary change in this release is the following bug fix:</br></br>- **Introduce fixRemoveNFTokenAutoTrustLine amendment**: Introduces the `fixRemoveNFTokenAutoTrustLine` amendment, which disables the `tfTrustLine` flag, which a malicious attacker could exploit to mount denial-of-service attacks against NFT issuers that specified the flag on their NFTs.

      <td># Release Notes for Bitcoin Cash Node version 25.0.0</br></br>Bitcoin Cash Node version 25.0.0 is now available from:</br></br>  &lt;https://bitcoincashnode.org&gt;</br></br>## Overview</br></br>This is a major release of Bitcoin Cash Node (BCHN) that implements the [May 15, 2023 Network Upgrade](https://upgradespecs.bitcoincashnode.org/2023-05-15-upgrade/).</br></br>This release implements the following consensus CHIPs:</br></br>- [CHIP-2021-01 Restrict Transaction Version](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin.cash/chips/-/blob/3b0e5d55e1e139046794e850287b7acb795f4e66/CHIP-2021-01-Restrict%20Transaction%20Versions.md) v1.0</br>- [CHIP-2021-01 Minimum Transaction Size](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin.cash/chips/-/blob/00e55fbfdaacf1436e455289086d9b4c6b3e7306/CHIP-2021-01-Allow%20Smaller%20Transactions.md) v0.4</br>- [CHIP-2022-02 CashTokens](https://github.com/bitjson/cashtokens) v2.2.1</br>- [CHIP-2022-05 P2SH32](https://gitlab.com/0353F40E/p2sh32/-/blob/f58ecf835f58555c9087c53af25da92a0e74534c/CHIP-2022-05_Pay-to-Script-Hash-32_%28P2SH32%29_for_Bitcoin_Cash.md) v1.5.1</br></br>This version contains further corrections and improvements, such as:</br></br>- Support for new 'chipnet' test network (for pre-upgrade testing)</br>- Double Spend Proof notifications in the GUI wallet</br>- BIP69 input/output sorting in bitcoin-tx command line tool</br>- Enhancement for UI tests in test framework</br></br>Users who are running any of our previous releases (24.x.y) are urged to upgrade to v25.0.0 ahead of 15 May 2023.</br></br>## Usage recommendations</br></br>The update to Bitcoin Cash Node 25.0.0 is required for the May 15, 2023 Bitcoin Cash network upgrade.</br></br>While there are no known regressions in this version at this time, as always we recommend that all users inform us of any potential regressions via our support channels.</br></br>Existing users, whether miners, exchanges or personal wallet users can expect to continue status quo operations without disruption by simply swapping binaries and restarting the node before May 2023, as long as they do not need the additional functionalities of Cashtokens and P2SH32. While Cashtokens and P2SH32 usage will already be possible after activation through custom software, exchanges looking to gain these capabilities may want to watch for a future release of BCHN that includes better support in the bundled wallet and RPC commands.</br></br>No post-activation tokens are going to be accidentally lost for any legacy operators who do not take any additional steps other than upgrading their nodes to this release.</br></br>Block explorer operators may begin to see transactions of a new and unfamiliar format in Cashtokens after upgrade activation. While these transactions should not impede status quo operations, operators may wish to modify their software in order to interpret the additional token information they carry.</br></br>This client release has a built-in expiry date of April 15, 2024, ie. a month ahead of the (tentative) next upgrade after May 2023. The expiry mechanism causes upgrade warnings to be issued, and preventively disables RPC if the software is run past the (tentative) scheduled upgrade date of May 2024.</br></br>## Network changes</br></br>### New test network supported: chipnet</br></br>A new `chipnet` test network has been added to enable testing of all the new upgrade features (such as CashTokens, P2SH-32) ahead of the mainnet upgrade.</br></br>This network can be accessed by running with the `-chipnet` option. It has activated the new features already, 6 months early, on 15 November, 2022.</br></br>Technically, it is a chain fork of 'testnet4', with much the same qualities. Its default ports are 48333, 48332, and 48334 for p2p, rpc, and onion respectively.</br></br>It retains the same cashaddr prefix as the other testnets: `bchtest:` and the same legacy address checksum bytes. Like testnet4, it defaults to 2MB blocks and defaults to requiring standard txns for relay.</br></br>Further parameters are described in more detail in `doc/test-networks.md`.</br></br>Historical discussion on its creation can be found here:</br></br>https://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/staging-chips-on-testnet</br></br>Seeders for this network should be started with -chipnet, and bitcoind should be started with `-chipnet` and also have a section `[chip]` for the new network.</br></br>## Added functionality</br></br>### 32-byte Pay-to-Script-Hash (P2SH-32)</br></br>P2SH-32 (pay-to-scripthash 32) support has been added and consensus rules for this feature will activate on May 15, 2023.</br></br>This is a feature that provides more protection to certain smart contracts. It is currently only usable through the RPC interface, and sending is not enabled by default in the wallet functionality or accessible via the GUI, except through RPC commands. Receipt of P2SH-32 transactions is supported.</br></br>For more information on P2SH-32, see:</br></br>- [CHIP-2022-05 P2SH32](https://gitlab.com/0353F40E/p2sh32/-/blob/f58ecf835f58555c9087c53af25da92a0e74534c/CHIP-2022-05_Pay-to-Script-Hash-32_%28P2SH32%29_for_Bitcoin_Cash.md)</br>- Discussion: https://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/chip-2022-05-pay-to-script-hash-32-p2sh32-for-bitcoin-cash/</br></br>### 'sort' command added to bitcoin-tx</br></br>The 'sort' command can be used to sort inputs and outputs according to BIP69.</br></br>Note that sorting usually requires re-signing (similar to other commands that mutate the transaction in some way).</br></br>BIP69 sorting is enabled by default in the wallet application.</br></br>### Visual indication of transactions involved in Double Spend Proof</br></br>Upon arrival of a Double Spend Proof (DSProof), an application notification will be shown, additional information will be shown in the transaction list and transaction info window.</br></br>DSProof related transactions are indicated with a red color and an exclamation mark symbol in the graphical user interface.</br></br>Note: The GUI does not store information about transactions that have been double spent in the wallet.dat file. A restart of the GUI therefore clears the history and these transactions will look 'normal' again.</br></br>## Deprecated functionality</br></br>Currently, standard relay rules restrict transaction versions to either 1 or 2.</br></br>After May 2023 upgrade, transaction versions will be restricted to be either 1 or 2 as a consensus rule, i.e. strictly enforced.</br>Therefore, applications that create transactions should not generate transaction versions other than 1 or 2, otherwise their transactions will be rejected after the upgrade.</br></br>Note: This is perhaps not strictly a deprecation, since we are not aware of any applications generating other transaction versions, but since consensus is being tightened up here, it seems prudent to mention it.</br></br>## Modified functionality</br></br>### New cash address formats for token-aware P2PKH and P2SH</br></br>Two new "address types" have been added to the cash address format.</br>These are described in the CashTokens v2.2.1 specification.</br></br>- TOKEN_PUBKEY (token-aware p2pkh, type=2)</br>- TOKEN_SCRIPT (token-aware p2sh, type=3)</br></br>The "address type" is encoded into the cashaddress string. Thus wallets wishing to signal token awareness will be required to</br>advertise their addresses using these two new "address types", making token-aware addresses distinct from the plain cash addresses.</br></br>For example the following p2pkh:</br></br>```</br>bitcoincash:qr6m7j9njldwwzlg9v7v53unlr4jkmx6eylep8ekg2</br>```</br></br>Could also be encoded as signaling token-awareness and it would look like this:</br></br>```</br>bitcoincash:zr6m7j9njldwwzlg9v7v53unlr4jkmx6eycnjehshe</br>```</br></br>Both of these addresses end up mapping to the same locking script.</br></br>Notes:</br></br>Token-aware addresses are not yet supported in the wallet database (wallet.dat). The bitcoin-qt wallet (and the RPC wallet) store addresses internally in the wallet.dat as "legacy" strings thus the "token awareness" of an address you sent to is "lost" in the UI or in RPC wallet history. So if one were to send to a 'z' address, when reading back the history one would be told it was a regular q address (same destination). This limitation will be removed in subsequent release to bring more token support.</br></br>The node wallet itself does not advertise these new "token aware" addresses when you ask it for a new receiving address, since at the</br>present time the wallet cannot actually manage and send tokens. The CashTokens specification says only wallets that can send tokens</br>may advertise these new type=2 and type=3 addresses. In future work we may add support for managing and sending CashTokens, at which time the wallet UI and RPC would be updated to advertise "token aware" addresses.</br></br>### 'getdsproofscore' DSProof scoring RPC</br></br>The 0.25 scoring criterion of the `getdsproofscore` RPC has been extended to trigger if a transaction or any of its in-mempool ancestors happens to have a P2PKH input that is not signed with SIGHASH_ALL or is signed with SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY (which indicates very weak DSProof protection).</br></br>As before this release, a value of 0.25 may also indicate that up to the first 20,000 unconfirmed ancestors were checked and all have no proofs but *can* have proofs. Since the transaction in question has a very large mempool ancestor set, double-spend confidence should be considered medium-to-low.</br>This value may also be returned for transactions which exceed depth 1,000 in an unconfirmed ancestor chain.</br></br>### Two error messages have changed:</br></br>- If the node receives a transaction that spends an UTXO with a locking script &gt;10,000 bytes, the node now generates the error message</br>  `bad-txns-input-scriptpubkey-unspendable`.   Previously it would generate the message</br>  `mandatory-script-verify-flag-failed (Script is too big)`</br></br>- Similarly, if the node receives a transaction that spends an `OP_RETURN`   output, the node now generates the error message</br>  `bad-txns-input-scriptpubkey-unspendable`.  Previously it would generate the message</br>  `mandatory-script-verify-flag-failed (OP_RETURN was encountered)`</br></br>The reason for this change is that sometimes an oversized locking script ended up "looking like" an `OP_RETURN` when read from the UTXO database. In that case, the previous behavior was inconsistent because it depended on whether the output being spent was consuming an output still in memory or coming from the UTXO db.  Thus, it was possible to receive the `OP_RETURN`-related error message when actually attempting to spend an output with an oversized locking script.  As such, the two ambiguous cases have been</br>collapsed down into 1 consistent error message.</br></br>This error message change does mean that the node will now push a different BIP61 string to its peers when it receives an invalid transaction that triggers these error conditions.  However, no known nodes actually pay much attention to the exact format of the error message that they receive when a transaction is rejected by a peer, so this change should be relatively benign.</br></br>### P2SH-32 addresses are now supported by RPC</br></br>Certain RPC methods that take an `address` parameter (such as `sendtoaddress`) will now also correctly parse P2SH-32 addresses and thus will allow composing of transactions and sending of funds to P2SH-32 addresses, even before the May 15, 2023 upgrade date.</br></br>Note that on mainnet such transactions will remain non-standard and cannot be relayed until P2SH-32 activates on May 15, 2023.</br></br>P2SH-32 addresses are longer than regular P2SH addresses, for example:</br></br>```</br>bitcoincash:pwqwzrf7z06m7nn58tkdjyxqfewanlhyrpxysack85xvf3mt0rv02l9dxc5uf</br>```</br></br>is a P2SH-32 address.</br></br>Calls like 'decoderawtransaction' or 'getrawtransaction' will now be able to emit this new kind of address. Software which processes output of these calls should take this into consideration. Software that is sanitizing inputs should also be extended to anticipate</br>these P2SH-32 addresses.</br></br>### Cash Token information support in RPC interfaces</br></br>The following RPC calls have been extended with facilities to transport or accept information about Cash Tokens:</br></br>- `gettxout`: `tokenData` JSON object is present if the output contains token data</br>- `scantxoutset`: a `tok&lt;category&gt;` output descriptor has been added to allow matching of token outputs with a specific category (token ID). The call will return token data in this case, including the total amount of each fungible token.</br>- `validateaddress`: an `istokenaware` boolean result field indicates whether the address type supports Cash Tokens or not.</br>- `getrawtransaction`: `tokenData` JSON object is present for outputs that contain token data</br>- `decoderawtransaction`: `tokenData` JSON object is present for outputs that contain token data</br>- `signrawtransactionwithkey`: the `prevtxs` object has been extended with an optional `tokenData` object containing token data fields. The `sighashtype` field has also been extended with combinations including SIGHASH_UTXO (0x20), which is a new sighash type introduced in the CashTokens specification, and only valid after the upgrade.</br>- `decodepsbt`: the input `utxo` object has been extended with optional `tokenData`</br>- `listunspent`: extended by two new boolean options controlling the listed results:</br>  - `includeTokens` (default: false): whether to show UTXOs with CashTokens on them</br>  - `tokensOnly` (default: false): whether to only show UTXOs with CashTokens on them  (implies `includeTokens=true`)</br>  The `listunspent` result will contain `tokenData` objects for unspent outputs that carry token data.</br>- `signrawtransactionwithwallet`: the `prevtxs` object has been extended with an optional `tokenData` object containing token data fields. The `sighashtype` field has also been extended with combinations including SIGHASH_UTXO (0x20), which is a new sighash type introduced in the CashTokens specification, and only valid after the upgrade.</br>- `walletprocesspsbt`: extended with SIGHASH_UTXO (0x20) sighash type combos. SIGHASH_UTXO is only valid after the upgrade.</br></br>Please refer to the help documentation for the respective RPC call for more detailed information on the structure of the token-relevant data objects.</br></br>Further support for tokens over more RPC commands are expected in one of the next releases.</br></br>## Removed functionality</br></br>The previously deprecated `setexcessiveblock` RPC call has been removed. Please use the `excessiveblocksize` configuration setting instead.</br></br>## New RPC methods</br></br>No new RPC methods have been added, but certain RPC methods have been extended to support CashToken information and to accept P2SH-32 addresses.</br></br>Please refer to above sections on 'Modified Functionality' for details.</br></br>## User interface changes</br></br>Several RPC calls have been extended to support token data. These are listed separately in the section above titled 'Cash Token information support in RPC interfaces'.</br></br>### GUI: notification and indication of double spends</br></br>The above section 'Visual indication of transactions involved in Double Spend Proof' describes the new GUI notification and indication of DSProofs.</br></br>### New client option `-allowunconnectedmining`</br></br>This option defaults to false which preserves previous behavior.</br></br>If this option is set to true, the node will not require that it be connected to at least one peer node before `getblocktemplate[light]` works correctly. This is a "debug" option and its help description can only be seen with `-hh` to bitcoind.</br></br>### New client option `-chipnet` (default: false)</br></br>This option is used to synchronise with the new 'chipnet' test network. It defaults to false (same as the other testnet selector options).</br></br>For more details on 'chipnet' and other test networks, refer to:</br></br>https://docs.bitcoincashnode.org/doc/test-networks</br></br>Note: The bitcoin.conf configuration file option is `chipnet=1` with a corresponding new section title of '[chip]'.</br></br>### New client option `-upgrade10activationtime`</br></br>This option does not do much but controls the (tentative) upgrade MTP time for the upgrade 10 (tentatively 15 May 2024, 12:00 UTC).</br></br>This setting also controls the expiration warning time of the client. This will start warning about expiration due to coming upgrade,</br>one month ahead (i.e. in April 2024).</br></br>### RPC `createrawtransaction` accepts "data" array</br></br>The `createrawtransaction` now accepts an array of hex encoded data chunks each of which is pushed to stack separately.</br></br>### RPC `getrawtransaction` extended verbosity argument</br></br>The `verbose` argument of the `getrawtransaction` RPC call has been extended to represent a verbosity level. A new verbosity level 2 is introduced which allows for prevout lookup, input value determination and transaction fee calculation.</br></br>### New BIP69 'sort' command for bitcoin-tx tool</br></br>As described above in the section "'sort' command added to bitcoin-tx", this add BIP69 input/output sorting capability to the bitcoin-tx tool.</br></br>### Uniform dumping stats for mempool and DSProofs</br></br>The `debug.log` output for the dumping mempool and DSProof data on client shutdown have been made uniform and slightly enhanced. This diagnostic change will not be of interest to most users.</br></br>## Regressions</br></br>Bitcoin Cash Node 25.0.0 does not introduce any known regressions as compared to 24.1.0.</br></br>## Limitations</br></br>The following are limitations in this release of which users should be aware:</br></br>1. CashToken support is low-level at this stage. The wallet application does not yet keep track of the user's tokens.</br>   Tokens are only manageable via RPC commands currently.</br>   They only persist through the UTXO database and block database at this point.</br>   There are existing RPC commands to list and filter for tokens in the UTXO set.</br>   RPC raw transaction handling commands have been extended to allow creation (and sending) of token transactions.</br>   Interested users are advised to consult the functional test in `test/functional/bchn-rpc-tokens.py` for examples on token transaction construction and listing.</br>   Future releases will aim to extend the RPC API with more convenient ways to create and spend tokens, as well as upgrading the wallet storage and indexing subsystems to persistently store data about tokens of interest</br>   to the user. Later we expect to add GUI wallet management of Cash Tokens.</br></br>2. Transactions with SIGHASH_UTXO are not covered by DSProofs at present.</br></br>3. P2SH-32 is not used by default in the wallet (regular P2SH-20 remains the default wherever P2SH is treated).</br></br>4. The markup of Double Spend Proof events in the wallet does not survive a restart of the wallet, as the information is not persisted to the wallet.</br></br>## Known Issues</br></br>Some issues could not be closed in time for release, but we are tracking all of them on our GitLab repository.</br></br>- The minimum macOS version is 10.14 (Mojave). Earlier macOS versions are no longer supported.</br></br>- Windows users are recommended not to run multiple instances of bitcoin-qt or bitcoind on the same machine if the wallet feature is enabled. There is risk of data corruption if instances are configured to use the same wallet folder.</br></br>- Some users have encountered unit tests failures when running in WSL environments (e.g. WSL/Ubuntu).  At this time, WSL is not considered a supported environment for the software. This may change in future.</br></br>  The functional failure on WSL is tracked in [Issue #33](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/33).</br>  It arises when competing node program instances are not prevented from opening the same wallet folder. Running multiple program instances with the same configured walletdir could potentially lead to data corruption. The failure has not been observed on other operating systems so far.</br></br>- `doc/dependencies.md` needs revision ([Issue #65](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/65)).</br></br>- For users running from sources built with BerkeleyDB releases newer than the 5.3 which is used in this release, please take into consideration the database format compatibility issues described in [Issue #34](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/34). When building from source it is recommended to use BerkeleyDB 5.3 as this avoids wallet database incompatibility issues with the official release.</br></br>- The `test_bitcoin-qt` test executable fails on Linux Mint 20 (see [Issue #144](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/144)). This does not otherwise appear to impact the functioning of the BCHN software on that platform.</br></br>- With a certain combination of build flags that included disabling the QR code library, a build failure was observed where an erroneous  linking against the QR code library (not present) was attempted ([Issue #138](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/138)).</br></br>- Possible out-of-memory error when starting bitcoind with high excessiveblocksize value ([Issue #156](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/156))</br></br>- A problem was observed on scalenet where nodes would sometimes hang for around 10 minutes, accepting RPC connections but not responding to them (see [Issue #210](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/210)).</br></br>- At the time of writing, scalenet has not been mined for a while (since 10 August 2022), thus synchronization will stop at that block time.  This isn't considered a BCHN issue per se, it depends on miners to resume mining this testnet.</br></br>- Startup and shutdown time of nodes on scalenet can be long (see [Issue #313](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/313)).</br></br>- Race condition in one of the `p2p_invalid_messages.py` tests (see [Issue #409](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/409)).</br></br>- Occasional failure in bchn-txbroadcastinterval.py (see [Issue #403](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/403)).</br></br>- wallet_keypool.py test failure when run as part of suite on certain many-core platforms (see [Issue #380](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/380)).</br></br>- Spurious 'insufficient funds' failure during p2p_stresstest.py benchmark (see [Issue #377](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/377)).</br></br>- If compiling from source, secp256k1 now no longer works with latest openssl3.x series. There are workarounds (see [Issue #364](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/364)).</br></br>- Spurious `AssertionError: Mempool sync timed out` in several tests (see [Issue #357](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/357)).</br></br>- For some platforms, there may be a need to install additional libraries in order to build from source (see [Issue #431](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/431) and discussion in MR 1523).</br></br>- More TorV3 static seeds may be needed to get `-onlynet=onion` working (see [Issue #429](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/429)).</br></br>---</br></br>## Changes since Bitcoin Cash Node 24.1.0</br></br>### New documents</br></br>None.</br></br>### Removed documents</br></br>None.</br></br>### Notable commits grouped by functionality</br></br>#### Security or consensus relevant fixes</br></br>- 9d8c67ee480bbe13586404422c20d4958893e64b Upgrade9 (May 2023) -
