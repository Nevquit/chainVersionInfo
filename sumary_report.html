      <td>After a long train of maintenance releases, we are happy to announce this feature release of Geth!</br></br>**This release is ready for the Merge transition on the Ropsten testnet**, and will activate the Merge on Ropsten **when the testnet reaches a total difficulty of 43531756765713534**. Please ensure you have a beacon chain node configured for the transition. </br></br>You can find more information about preparing for the Merge in our guide: &lt;https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interface/merge&gt;</br></br>The tracing subsystem has been another focus area of this release cycle. We have replaced the JavaScript interpreter used by the tracing engine with [Goja](github.com/dop251/goja), which offers slightly better performance and implements many ES6 language features. There are minor differences in JS tracing semantics: The built-in functions `memory.slice`, `memory.getUint`, `stack.peek` will now throw an exception and interrupt tracing when accessing out-of-bounds data. They previously returned an empty value instead.</br></br>This release contains further breaking changes to tracing APIs. Be sure to check the tracing changelog section. Please also report any incompatibilities you encounter.</br></br>### Changes related to the Merge</br></br>- Ropsten: terminal total difficulty is configured for the Merge. ([#24876](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24876))</br>- In RPC APIs where a block number can be given, you can now use `"finalized"` to refer to the latest finalized block. ([#24282](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24282))</br>- Geth can now serve CL requests to build a new block with very low latency because new blocks are constructed in the background. ([#24866](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24866))</br>- For CL-induced reorgs to a block with unavailable state, Geth now recomputes the state by re-processing ancestor blocks. ([#24613](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24613))</br>- The "engine" API implementation complies with the latest specification version. ([#24802](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24802), [#24855](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24855), [#24915](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24915))</br>- Several annoyances related to sync after the Merge have been fixed. ([#24691](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24691), [#24670](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24670), [#24610](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24610))</br></br>### Geth changes</br></br>- Geth's default gas limit target is now 30M. ([#24680](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24680))</br>- Geth now prints a warning when launching on the deprecated Rinkeby testnet. ([#24884](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24884))</br>- The free disk space monitor is more aggressive and the critical level at which it will initiate a shutdown is now set to 256 MB by default. ([#24781](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24781))</br>- Geth now prints a small guide when started in `--dev` mode. ([#24759](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24759))</br>- Geth no longer reports 'Snapshot extension registration failed' as an error. ([#24475](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24475))</br>- The `--eth.requiredblocks` flag was fixed to work correctly. ([#24817](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24817))</br>- Using `geth --dev` with a datadir previously initialized by `geth init` should now work correctly. ([#24693](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24693))</br>- `geth init` will now complain when creating a Clique-based chain without any configured signers. ([#24470](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24470))</br>- The new `geth db check-state-content` command checks integrity of trie nodes in the database. ([#24840](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24840))</br>- `geth snapshot verify-state` now checks for 'dangling' storage entries. ([#24643](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24643), [#24677](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24677))</br>- `evm t8n` can now run post-merge state transitions. ([#24546](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24546))</br>- The hex input data of `evm run` is now verified to have even length. ([#24721](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24721))</br>- Using Clef for clique block signing should be fixed. ([#24941](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24941))</br>- The example code that shows how to use Clef from Python works again. ([#24440](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24440))</br></br>### Core changes</br></br>- When generating a state snapshot from the state trie, Geth now ensures that 'dangling' storage entries from previous snapshots are removed from the database. This fixes an issue that could lead to incorrect EVM execution results after snap sync in certain cases. ([#24811](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24811))</br>- The transaction pool now correctly drops the oldest transactions when truncating the queue to stay below the configured global limit. ([#24908](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24908))</br>- The reference tests have been upgraded to version 10.4. ([#24899](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24899))</br>- EVM `MSTORE` is now 75% faster. ([#24847](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24847), [#24860](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24860))</br>- The EVM now implements EIP-3855 (PUSH0 instruction). This feature is not yet active in any fork. ([#24039](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24039))</br>- The ancient store ('freezer') implementation is now exported in package ethdb, and can be used independently of the chain database. ([#24684](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24684))</br>- The miner no longer commits the in-progress block to disk when interrupted by a new chain head event. This improves block creation latency. ([#24638](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24638))</br>- The Goerli testnet has new bootstrap nodes. ([#24900](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24900))</br>- An crash in LES ultralight sync is resolved. ([#24641](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24641))</br>- Several data races related to snap sync are fixed in this release. ([#24685](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24685))</br>- The snap protocol server no longer includes superfluous account proofs when a storage response hits the size limit. ([#24885](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24885))</br>- The snap client now de-duplicates trie node heal requests better, sorting them by the requested state trie path. This can slightly reduce the overall amount of data transferred during snap sync. ([#24779](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24779))</br>- The eth block fetcher now disconnects peers that repeatedly fail to reply to header requests. ([#24652](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24652))</br>- The trie implementation can now optionally trace nodes which were deleted/overwritten by state updates. ([#24403](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24403))</br></br>### Go library changes</br></br>- common/compiler: The Solidity and Vyper wrappers have been removed. This is a breaking change. ([#24936](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24936))</br>- `abigen --sol` does not work anymore. ([#24936](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24936))</br>- ethclient: `Client` now has a `PeerCount` method. ([#24849](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24849))</br>- ethclient/gethclient: `GetProof` now also returns storage proofs ([#24697](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24697))</br>- accounts/abi: decoder no longer crashes for invalid struct field names. ([#24932](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24932))</br>- accounts/abi: logs are now decoded correctly when all arguments are indexed. ([#24792](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24792))</br>- accounts/abi: `ParseSelector` now handles tuple arrays. ([#24587](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24587))</br>- signer/fourbyte: 4byte signatures have been updated. ([#22865](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/22865), [#24842](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24842))</br>- mobile: `Receipt.EncodeJSON` now actually returns JSON instead of RLP. ([#24701](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24701))</br>- accounts/abi/bind: contract calls on the `pending` block now correctly return the `eth_call` RPC error, if any. ([#24649](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24649))</br>- core/types: the `miner` field is now optional when decoding block headers from JSON ([#24666](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24666))</br>- ethdb/remotedb: it is now possible to attach a chain database via RPC. This feature is meant to be used for debugging. ([#24905](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24905), [#24836](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24836))</br></br>### Tracing changes</br></br>- The JavaScript tracing environment now uses the Goja interpreter instead of Duktape. There should be no noticable differences in semantics resulting from this change. ([#23773](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/23773), [#24934](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24934))</br>- In JS tracers, the `log.memory` object now has a `length` method. ([#24887](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24887))</br>- **API change**: In all tracers (JS, native, structlog), memory content is now captured before the EVM expands it. Previously, tracing would see memory after it had already been affected by the current instruction. ([#24867](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24867))</br>- **API change**: `debug_traceTransaction`, in the default structured-logging mode, now returns the refund counter for every EVM execution step. ([#24567](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24567))</br>- **API change**: in structlog steps, the fields `memory` and `returnData` will only be present when they contain non-empty data. ([#24547](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24547))</br>- Tracing now takes refunds and access list costs into account. This fixes inaccuracies: in JS tracers, the `intrinsicGas` property is now correct even when there are refunds. In the built-in "prestate" tracer, the sender balance added to the result should now be the true balance at the beginning of the transaction. ([#24510](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24510))</br>- In native (Go) tracers, the txhash/blockhash being traced is now available. ([#24679](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24679))</br></br>### RPC / GraphQL changes</br></br>- The GraphQL API now supports retrieving the binary representation of consensus objects. ([#24816](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24816), [#24738](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24738))</br>- In GraphQL queries, values of type `Long` (representing a block number, for example) can now be set using a query variable. ([#24864](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24864))</br>- Error messages printed/returned when accessing missing block logs are improved. ([#24617](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24617))</br>- `debug_testSignCliqueBlock` is not available anymore. ([#24837](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24837))</br>- The new `debug_getRawReceipts` RPC method returns the binary representation of block receipts. ([#24773](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24773))</br>- The new `debug_dbGet` method can be used to read from the chain database. ([#24739](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24739))</br></br>### Build changes</br></br>- This release is built with Go 1.18.1 ([#24689](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24689))</br>- Our PPA now publishes .deb packages for Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. ([#24813](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24813))</br>- Incremental builds of Docker images of Geth should be faster. ([#24796](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24796))</br>- Code generation tools are now tracked by go.mod, making `go generate` more deterministic. ([#24682](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24682))</br>- go-ethereum now uses the toolchain feature 'embed' instead of go-bindata. It is no longer necessary to run `go generate` after changing certain assets such as JS files. ([#24744](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24744))</br>- go-ethereum now takes advantage of several standard library features available in Go 1.16 and later. ([#24886](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24886), [#24869](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24869), [#24890](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24890), [#24861](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24861), [#24835](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24835), [#24633](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24633))</br>- Dependency conflicts related to github.com/btcsuite/btcd v0.22.0 are fixed. ([#24700](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24700), [#24939](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24939))</br></br>For a full rundown of the changes please consult the Geth 1.10.18 [release milestone](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/milestone/130?closed=1).</br></br>---</br></br>As with all our previous releases, you can find the:</br></br>- Pre-built binaries for all platforms on our [downloads page](https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/).</br>- Docker images published under [`ethereum/client-go`](https://cloud.docker.com/u/ethereum/repository/docker/ethereum/client-go).</br>- Ubuntu packages in our [Launchpad PPA repository](https://launchpad.net/~ethereum/+archive/ubuntu/ethereum).</br>- OSX packages in our [Homebrew Tap repository](https://github.com/ethereum/homebrew-ethereum).</br></td>

      <td>Litecoin Core v0.21.2 Release</br>==============</br></br>Follow our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/litecoinproject) for the latest dev news.</br></br>We are pleased to release Litecoin Core 0.21.2. This is a new major version release, including new features, various bugfixes and performance improvements, as well as updated translations. This update includes full node, wallet and mining support for MWEB. It is recommended for all users to upgrade to this version.</br></br>How to upgrade: </br>==============</br></br>Firstly, thank you for running Litecoin Core and helping secure the network!</br></br>As you’re running an older version of Litecoin Core, shut it down. Wait until it’s completely shut down  - which might take a few minutes for older versions - then follow these simple steps:</br>For Windows: simply run the installer </br>For Mac: copy over to `/Applications/Litecoin-Qt` </br>For Linux: copy cover `litecoind`/`litecoin-qt`.</br></br>NB: upgrading directly from an ‘end of life’ version of Litecoin Core is possible, but it might take a while if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old wallet versions of Litecoin Core are generally supported.</br> </br></br>Compatibility:</br>==============</br></br>Litecoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.10+,  Windows 7 and newer. It’s not recommended to use Litecoin Core on unsupported systems.</br></br>Litecoin Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems, but is not as frequently tested on them.</br></br>MWEB fields added to BlockIndex, and block serialization format has changed. Downgrading to older versions is unsafe.</br></br>If upgrading to 0.21.2 *after* MWEB has activated, you must resync to download MWEB blocks.</br></br>Notable changes</br>===============</br></br>Consensus changes</br>-----------------</br></br>- This release implements the proposed MWEB consensus rules</br>  ([LIP002](https://github.com/litecoin-project/lips/blob/master/lip-0002.mediawiki),</br>  [LIP003](https://github.com/litecoin-project/lips/blob/master/lip-0003.mediawiki), and</br>  [LIP004](https://github.com/litecoin-project/lips/blob/master/lip-0004.mediawiki))</br></br>P2P and network changes</br>-----------------------</br></br>- A new service flag, NODE_MWEB (1 &lt;&lt; 24), was added to signal to peers that the node supports MWEB.</br>  When connected peers both advertise this capability, they are expected to provide all MWEB data when</br>  sharing transactions, blocks, and compact blocks with each other.</br></br>- Nodes now announce compact block version 3 support, informing peers that they can provide MWEB data</br>  in compact blocks.</br></br></br>Updated RPCs</br>------------</br></br>- `getblockheader` now returns an additional `mweb_header` field containing</br>  all of the MWEB header data, and an `mweb_amount` field containing the total</br>  number of coins pegged-in to the MWEB after applying the block.</br></br>- `getblock` now returns an additional `mweb` field containing MWEB header info,</br>  and all of the inputs, outputs, and kernels in the MWEB block.</br></br>- Added `mwebweight`, `descendantmwebweight`, `ancestormwebweight`, and `mweb`</br>  fields to `getrawmempool`, `getmempoolancestors`, `getmempooldescendants`,</br>  and `getmempoolentry`.</br></br>- Added new fields to describe MWEB transaction inputs, outputs, and kernels</br>  for `getrawtransaction`.</br></br>Changes to Wallet or GUI related RPCs can be found in the GUI or Wallet section below.</br></br>New settings</br>------------</br></br>- Added "fMWEBFeatures" option for enabling the new "Advanced MWEB Features"</br>  control.</br></br>Wallet Database</br>---------------</br></br>- Added "mweb_coin" type which stores MWEB coins and their derived keys.</br></br>- Added CHDChain version 4 which includes an MWEB key index counter and</br>  the stealth address scan key.</br></br>- Added CKeyMetadata version 14 which includes the MWEB key index.</br></br>- Added FEATURE_MWEB = 210000 minimum database version.</br></br>Wallet RPC changes</br>------------------</br></br>- Added 'listwallettransactions' which matches the transaction list display values.</br></br>GUI changes</br>-----------</br></br>- Added an "Advanced MWEB Features" control for testing. It’s only available</br>  when the "-debug" argument is supplied, and the option is turned on in the</br>  settings dialog.</br></br>Download Binaries</br>=======</br></br>To download, please visit the download page [here](https://litecoin.org/).

      <td>Version 1.9.1 of `rippled`, the reference server implementation of the XRP Ledger protocol, is now available. This release includes several important fixes, including a fix for a syncing issue from 1.9.0, a new fix amendment to correct a bug in the new Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) code, and a new amendment to allow multi-signing by up to 32 signers.</br></br>&lt;!-- BREAK --&gt;</br></br></br>## Action Required</br></br>This release introduces two new amendments to the XRP Ledger protocol. These amendments are now open for voting according to the XRP Ledger's [amendment process](https://xrpl.org/amendments.html), which enables protocol changes following two weeks of &gt;80% support from trusted validators.</br></br>If you operate an XRP Ledger server, then you should upgrade to version 1.9.1 within two weeks, to ensure service continuity. The exact time that protocol changes take effect depends on the voting decisions of the decentralized network.</br></br>The **fixNFTokenDirV1** amendment fixes a bug in code associated with the **NonFungibleTokensV1** amendment, so the fixNFTokenDirV1 amendment should be enabled first. All validator operators are encouraged to [configure amendment voting](https://xrpl.org/configure-amendment-voting.html) to oppose the NonFungibleTokensV1 amendment until _after_ the fixNFTokenDirV1 amendment has become enabled. For more information about NFTs on the XRP Ledger, see [NFT Conceptual Overview](https://xrpl.org/nft-conceptual-overview.html).</br></br>The **ExpandedSignerList** amendment extends the ledger's built-in multi-signing functionality so that each list can contain up to 32 entries instead of the current limit of 8. Additionally, this amendment allows each signer to have an arbitrary 256-bit data field associated with it. This data can be used to identify the signer or provide other metadata that is useful for organizations, smart contracts, or other purposes.</br></br>## Install / Upgrade</br></br>On supported platforms, see the [instructions on installing or updating `rippled`](https://xrpl.org/install-rippled.html).</br></br>## Changelog</br></br>This release contains the following features and improvements.</br></br>## New Features and Amendments</br></br>- **Introduce fixNFTokenDirV1 Amendment** - This amendment fixes an off-by-one error that occurred in some corner cases when determining which `NFTokenPage` an `NFToken` object belongs on. It also adjusts the constraints of `NFTokenPage` invariant checks, so that certain error cases fail with a suitable error code such as `tecNO_SUITABLE_TOKEN_PAGE` instead of failing with a `tecINVARIANT_FAILED` error code. ([#4155](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/4155))</br></br>- **Introduce ExpandedSignerList Amendment** - This amendment expands the maximum signer list size to 32 entries and allows each signer to have an optional 256-bit `WalletLocator` field containing arbitrary data. ([#4097](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/4097))</br></br>- **Pause online deletion rather than canceling it if the server fails health check** - The server stops performing online deletion of old ledger history if the server fails its internal health check during this time. Online deletion can now resume after the server recovers, rather than having to start over. ([#4139](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/4139))</br></br></br>## Bug Fixes and Performance Improvements</br></br>- **Fix performance issues introduced in 1.9.0** - Readjusts some parameters of the ledger acquisition engine to revert some changes introduced in 1.9.0 that had adverse effects on some systems, including causing some systems to fail to sync to the network. ([#4152](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/4152))</br></br>- **Improve Memory Efficiency of Path Finding** - Finding paths for cross-currency payments is a resource-intensive operation. While that remains true, this fix improves memory usage of pathfinding by discarding trust line results that cannot be used before those results are fully loaded or cached. ([#4111](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/4111))</br></br>- **Fix incorrect CMake behavior on Windows when platform is unspecified or x64** - Fixes handling of platform selection when using the cmake-gui tool to build on Windows. The generator expects `Win64` but the GUI only provides `x64` as an option, which raises an error. This fix only raises an error if the platform is `Win32` instead, allowing the generation of solution files to succeed. ([#4150](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/4150))</br></br>- **Fix test failures with newer MSVC compilers on Windows** - Fixes some cases where the API handler code used string pointer comparisons, which may not work correctly with some versions of the MSVC compiler. ([#4149](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/4149))</br></br>- **Update minimum Boost version to 1.71.0** - This release is compatible with Boost library versions 1.71.0 through 1.77.0. The build configuration and documentation have been updated to reflect this. ([#4134](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/4134))</br></br>- **Fix unit test failures for DatabaseDownloader** - Increases a timeout in the `DatabaseDownloader` code and adjusts unit tests so that the code does not return spurious failures, and more data is logged if it does fail. ([#4021](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/4021))</br></br>- **Refactor relational database interface** - Improves code comments, naming, and organization of the module that interfaces with relational databases (such as the SQLite database used for tracking transaction history).

      <td># Release Notes for Bitcoin Cash Node version 24.0.0</br></br>Bitcoin Cash Node version 24.0.0 is now available from:</br></br>  &lt;https://bitcoincashnode.org&gt;</br></br>## Overview</br></br>This is a major release of Bitcoin Cash Node (BCHN) that implements the [May 15, 2022 Network Upgrade](https://upgradespecs.bitcoincashnode.org/2022-05-15-upgrade/). This release implements the following two consensus CHIPs:</br></br>- [CHIP-2021-03: Bigger Script Integers](https://gitlab.com/GeneralProtocols/research/chips/-/blob/master/CHIP-2021-02-Bigger-Script-Integers.md) increased precision for arithmetic operations.</br>- [CHIP-2021-02: Native Introspection Opcodes](https://gitlab.com/GeneralProtocols/research/chips/-/blob/master/CHIP-2021-02-Add-Native-Introspection-Opcodes.md) enabling smart contracts to inspect the current transaction.</br></br>This version contains further corrections and improvements, such as:</br></br>- [BIP69](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0069.mediawiki) (privacy) lexicographical sorting of transaction inputs/outputs</br>- A new wallet RPC call attribute ('include_unsafe') which enables creation of transactions which spend unconfirmed outputs (the default is still to spend only confirmed transactions)</br>- New settings, confirmation and error messages for the GUI to detect and warn the user about error-prone legacy address types.</br>- Update of the seeds and addition of a new seeder (bitjson.com)</br></br>Users who are running any of our previous releases (23.x.y) are urged to upgrade to v24.0.0 ahead of May 2022.</br></br></br>## Usage recommendations</br></br>The update to Bitcoin Cash Node 24.0.0 is required for the May 15, 2022 Bitcoin Cash network upgrade.</br></br></br>## Network changes</br></br>This release brings two consensus CHIPs (increased precision for arithmetic operations and native introspection opcodes) and one optional network change - BIP69 - the sorting of inputs and output in transactions generated by the wallet.</br></br>The first two (consensus changes) take effect with the upgrade in 15 May 2022.</br></br>BIP69 is effective immediately and enabled by default in this release. The pre-BIP69 behavior can be obtained by passing `-usebip69=0` on startup.</br></br></br>## Added functionality</br></br>- After activation of the May 2022 upgrade, smart contract designers will be able to use OP_MUL, native introspection opcodes and higher-precision integers in Script code.</br></br>- `coinsel` option has been added to `sendmany` RPC call. This was done to keep uniformity with 'sendtoaddress'.</br></br>- A new option `-usebip69` has been added to toggle BIP69 usage (it is enabled by default). This sorts the inputs and outputs of a transaction</br>  in lexicographical order to increase transactional privacy.</br></br>- The `fundrawtransaction`, `sendmany`, `sendtoaddress` and `walletcreatefundedpsbt` RPCs now support an `include_unsafe` option that, when `true`, allows using "unsafe inputs" to fund the transaction. The term "unsafe inputs" is a synonym for unconfirmed inputs not originating   from the wallet.  Note that the resulting transaction may become invalid if one of the "unsafe" inputs disappears due to a double-spend. This is a very unlikely scenario, however, on account of the strong zero-conf properties of the BCH network.  However, if that happens, the transaction must be funded with different inputs and republished.</br></br>- Two new options have been added to make legacy address handling safer in the GUI wallet: "Allow legacy P2PKH addresses" under Options &gt; Wallet and the `-allowlegacyp2sh` configuration option.</br></br>- A new CLI argument `-bytespersigcheck` has been introduced (conf file: `bytespersigcheck`). It is identical to the existing argument `-bytespersigop` (which has been deprecated), and the two arguments are now aliases for one other.</br></br>- A new option `-upgrade9activationtime` has been added to control the timestamp of the tentative upgrade in May 2023. This value is also used</br>  to set the software expiry time.</br></br>## Deprecated functionality</br></br>- The CLI argument `-bytespersigop` (conf file: `bytespersigop`) has been deprecated. Use `-bytespersigcheck` instead.</br></br>## Modified functionality</br></br>- The software expiry deadline has now been shifted from 15 May 2022 to 15 May 2023.</br></br>## Removed functionality</br></br>### autotools build system</br></br>The autotools build system is no longer supported by BCHN and has been removed. Please use the CMake / ninja build system.</br></br>### Mempool acceptance 'height' field in RPC calls</br></br>The `getmempoolentry` RPC call, the verbose modes of the `getrawmempool`/`getmempoolancestors`/`getmempooldescendants` RPC calls, and the JSON mode of the mempool REST call no longer include the `height` field. This used to indicate the block height upon mempool acceptance. However, it was not guaranteed to be accurate after a node restart or reorg, thus limiting its usefulness. Since it has been marked as deprecated for some time, it has been removed in the interests of efficiency.</br></br>### No more PPA support for Ubuntu 16.04</br></br>Ubuntu 16.04 is no longer supported via a PPA.</br></br>Users are encouraged to migrate to a more recent version of Ubuntu if they wish to use the Ubuntu PPAs.</br></br>Users who wish to compile from source are advised that the autotools build system is no longer supported from this release onwards.</br></br>## New RPC methods</br></br>None.</br></br>## User interface changes</br></br>Legacy address handling has been made safer in the GUI wallet. The aim is to save users from losing coins while using the error-prone legacy P2PKH and P2SH address types.</br></br>Such receiving address types are detected and the user is given relevant confirmation dialogs and error messages. For this legacy address handling, two new settings are introduced, one for P2PKH and one for P2SH addresses, to configure whether or not use of these legacy address types is allowed. These settings are:</br></br>- "Allow legacy P2PKH addresses" under Options &gt; Wallet</br>- `-allowlegacyp2sh` configuration option</br></br>## Regressions</br></br>Bitcoin Cash Node 24.0.0 does not introduce any known regressions as compared to 23.1.0.</br></br>## Known Issues</br></br>Some issues could not be closed in time for release, but we are tracking all of them on our GitLab repository.</br></br>- MacOS versions earlier than 10.12 are no longer supported. Additionally, Bitcoin Cash Node does not yet change appearance when macOS "dark mode" is activated.</br></br>- Windows users are recommended not to run multiple instances of bitcoin-qt or bitcoind on the same machine if the wallet feature is enabled.</br>  There is risk of data corruption if instances are configured to use the same wallet folder.</br></br>- Some users have encountered unit tests failures when running in WSL environments (e.g. WSL/Ubuntu).  At this time, WSL is not considered a supported environment for the software. This may change in future. The functional failure on WSL is tracked in [Issue #33](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/33). It arises when competing node program instances are not prevented from opening the same wallet folder. Running multiple program instances with the same configured walletdir could potentially lead to data corruption. The failure has not been observed on other operating systems so far.</br></br>- `doc/dependencies.md` needs revision ([Issue #65](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/65)).</br></br>- `test_bitcoin` can collide with temporary files if used by more than one user on the same system simultaneously. ([Issue #43](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/43))</br></br>- For users running from sources built with BerkeleyDB releases newer than the 5.3 which is used in this release, please take into consideration the database format compatibility issues described in [Issue #34](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/34). When building from source it is recommended to use BerkeleyDB 5.3 as this voids wallet database incompatibility issues with the official release.</br></br>- The `test_bitcoin-qt` test executable fails on Linux Mint 20 (see [Issue #144](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/144)). This does not otherwise appear to impact the functioning of the BCHN software on that platform.</br></br>- With a certain combination of build flags that included disabling the QR code library, a build failure was observed where an erroneous linking against the QR code library (not present) was attempted ([Issue #138](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/138)).</br></br>- Some functional tests are known to fail spuriously with varying probability. (see e.g. [Issue #148](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/148), and a fuller listing in [Issue #162](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/162)).</br></br>- Possible out-of-memory error when starting bitcoind with high excessiveblocksize value ([Issue #156](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/156))</br></br>- A problem was observed on scalenet where nodes would sometimes hang for around 10 minutes, accepting RPC connections but not responding to them (see [Issue #210](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/210)).</br></br>- Startup and shutdown time of nodes on scalenet can be long (see [Issue #313](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/313)).</br></br>- On some platforms, the splash screen can be maximized, but it cannot be unmaximized again (see [Issue #255](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/255)). This has only been observed on Mac OSX, not on Linux or Windows builds.</br></br>- There is an issue with `git-lfs` that may interfere with the refreshing of source code checkouts which have not been updated for a longer time (see Issues [#326](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/326), [#333](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/333)). A known workaround is to do a fresh clone of the repository.</br></br>---</br></br>## Changes since Bitcoin Cash Node 23.1.0</br></br>### New documents</br></br>The following are new documents in the BCHN software repository:</br></br>- [doc/gitian-building/gitian-building-docker.md](doc/gitian-building/gitian-building-docker.md): Adds a new streamlined Gitian setup guide tailored for Ubuntu/Debian users with Docker</br>- [doc/release-notes/release-notes-23.1.0.md](doc/release-notes/release-notes-23.1.0.md): The previous Release Notes</br></br>### Removed documents</br></br>None.</br></br>### Notable commits grouped by functionality</br></br>#### Security or consensus relevant fixes</br></br>None.</br></br>#### Interfaces / RPC</br></br>- af8ee2666dbd7653240117620ac96084b05fdae0 Bigger script integers (64-bit) implementation</br>- 05681fd0a614688430554b23b76fc01b8addb38a Implement bip69 and use in CWallet::CreateTransaction by default</br>- 4044ae2232059f6e96d2bc84179d56e5b6446506 Implementation of the Native Introspection proposal</br>- eff23d7d95e3cb47ef3f4aacbdcc1fac1347cfd4 Remove mempool acceptance block height field</br></br>#### Performance optimizations</br></br>- 3b44c66d9b10f30a954dac879e71ce0357b92b5a Remove `CTxMemPool::vTxHashes`</br></br>#### GUI</br></br>- 70460780ed480c22a917ca09a9614f1264f974b1 [qt][wallet] Safer legacy address handling for the GUI wallet</br>- 4e48ab0caac1b676a041fddcaba14c66e01f41ae Add guards and replace removed QWidget dependency</br></br>#### Data directory changes</br></br>None.</br></br>#### Code quality</br></br>- 60ae4cb4abf1d2b6d5eb71c2af69da9d39fd5b79 [qa] Fix compile warning about shadowed local in wallet_tests.cpp</br>- 5aba2e5381001c01b54c890e8bd9693f813b4946 [tests] Trivial: End object lifetime properly in a uint256 test</br>- ddfe6f4d4db8f08c165794da6119a63a2b32d682 Fix UB use of reinterpret_cast when working with sockets</br>- cfeb4093db9771889aa54b62985a8afc08b4e3c4 Fix compile warnings on newer clang</br>- bc30e7ad646554bf084e851a35d336b692f63c6f Remove old check for 3-byte shifted IP addresses from pre-0.2.9 node messages</br>- 234798dd814c55b6d44dabf37983a95d5c4b43b6 [qa] Update blockchain data sizes for mainnet, scalenet for v24.0.0</br>- fdb053f4d5666b152dc9751d1d30036798647d3c [qa] Update chain params (assumed valid and chainwork) for v24.0.0</br></br>#### Documentation updates</br></br>- b9edb72b06a1223f1761989be6ad649467f6ac5c [build][doc] Add Gitian on Docker guide &amp;
