      <td>This is a new minor version release, including important security updates and changes to network efficiency.</br></br>**All Dogecoin Core users - miners, services, relay operators and wallet users - are strongly recommended to upgrade.**</br></br>A full description of all changes is available in the [release notes](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes.md)</br></br>### Security-related fixes</br></br>This release contains multiple security related fixes:</br></br>- The alert system has been removed and processing of alert messages has been disabled</br>- The transaction download system has been made more reliable</br>- The protocol implementation has been amended to reject buggy or malformed messages</br>- Memory management in events of high network traffic or when connected to extremely slow peers has been improved</br></br>### Fee Recommendation</br></br>This release changes the **recommended dust limit** for all participants on the Dogecoin network from 1 DOGE to **0.01 DOGE**. The full recommendation can be found [in the documentation](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/blob/1.14.6-dev/doc/fee-recommendation.md).</br></br>### Breaking changes</br></br>- The behavior of the `dumpwallet` and `backupwallet` RPC methods, to exclusively write to the directory specified by `-backupdir` and no longer overwrite files</br>- The maximum number of `addnode` records that a node will track has been limited to 800</br></br>### New features</br></br>- A new RPC method, `liststucktransactions` has been added to help wallet operators identify if any transactions are stuck (have not been mined and are not in the mempool) and enable resolution. This helps in cases where node-local fee or dust policies change, to prevent the node from sending out old transactions that got lost.</br>- Pruning configuration has been added to the UI, to make it easier to save diskspace for users of graphical (wallet) installations. </br>- A new RPC method, `setmaxconnections`, has been introduced that enables wallet and node operators to change the maximum number of connections their node allows without needing to restart allowing for more fine-grained control of the node's network capacities.</br>- The graph in the UI's traffic monitor has been significantly improved by keeping track of the traffic we see in the background and then rendering it on demand, at any desired scale.</br>- A new RPC method, `rescan`, has been added to allow node operators to rescan the chain for wallet transactions from a certain height. This can help speed up the rescan process for keys that are known to be generated after a certain date or block height.</br>- A new endpoint has been added to the REST server to find the current best known block at a certain height, without having to do RPC calls. This is useful for service implementations that need to track or query blocks.</br></br>### Translation updates</br></br>- Bulgarian</br>- Dutch</br>- French</br>- Italian</br>- Korean</br>- Persian</br>- Portuguese (pt_PT)</br>- Tamil</br></br>### RPC API Changes</br></br>- The `verifychain` RPC command no longer accepts negative values</br>- `addnode` will now return error -32 when the address provided is too long</br>- `getpeerinfo` provides 2 new fields per peer, `addr_processed` and `addr_rate_limited`</br></br>### Dependency updates</br></br>- Updated `zlib` to 1.2.12.</br>- Updated `libevent` to 2.1.12-stable.</br>- Update the LevelDB subtree to use the same version as Bitcoin 22.0, from the [bitcoin-core maintained fork](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/leveldb-subtree).</br></td>

      <td>Geth v1.10.23 is a hotfix release for a pruning regression that was introduced in v1.10.22. For technical details on the bug, please check out the [PR that fixes it](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/25581).</br></br>If anyone updated to v1.10.22 in these past couple of days, there is a fairly high probability that some state data might have gone missing from your node. Doing a full check on the state is possible `geth snapshot traverse-state`, but will likely take a day and the fix is all the same anyway.</br></br>To ensure that your node has all the data, please rewind your local chain to a block before you updated (if unsure, just pick a block before the release time) with `debug.setHead("0xblock-number-in-hex")` via the Geth console (on IPC), or `debug_setHead` via JSON RPC (you might need to *temporarilly* expose the `debug` namespace to do that). The brute force alternative of course is to resync after an update, which you can do by deleting your `chaindata` folder (but please leave the `ancient` folder within to keep the blocks).</br></br>We apologize for this regression and the headaches fixing it will entail on your side. We've learnt the hard way that there's an untested class of bugs that appear across full sync restarts.</br></br>For a full rundown of the changes please consult the Geth [1.10.23 release milestone](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/milestone/135?closed=1).</br></br>---</br></br>As with all our previous releases, you can find the:</br></br>- Pre-built binaries for all platforms on our [downloads page](https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/).</br>- Docker images published under [`ethereum/client-go`](https://cloud.docker.com/u/ethereum/repository/docker/ethereum/client-go).</br>- Ubuntu packages in our [Launchpad PPA repository](https://launchpad.net/~ethereum/+archive/ubuntu/ethereum).</br>- OSX packages in our [Homebrew Tap repository](https://github.com/ethereum/homebrew-ethereum).</br></br>---</br></br>## Original Merge release notes</br></br>Geth ~v1.10.22~ v1.10.23 **enables the Merge for the Ethereum mainnet at a Terminal Total Difficulty of** `58_750_000_000_000_000_000_000`.</br></br>This TTD is expected to be reached on the 15. September 2022.</br></br>#### Merge EIPs</br>- [EIP-3676](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3675): Upgrade consensus to Proof-of-Stake</br>- [EIP-4339](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4399): Supplant DIFFICULTY opcode with PREVRANDAO</br></br>#### Additional notes about the merge changes</br></br>- This release configures the Terminal Total Difficulty for mainnet. ([#25528](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/25528))</br>- Many engine API issues found by hive have been fixed for this release. ([#25552](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/25552), [#25423](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/25423), [#25414](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/25414), [#25416](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/25416), [#25428](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/25428))</br>- The Goerli testnet is now internally configured as 'successfully merged'. ([#25519](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/25519), [#24538](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24538))</br></br>#### JSON-RPC API</br></br>- The log filtering system now uses a LRU cache for block logs, speeding up repeated queries for the same block range. The cache size can be configured using the `--cache.blocklogs` command-line flag. ([#25459](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/25459))</br>- `eth_createAccessList` is now much faster when no gas limit is provided. ([#25467](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/25467))</br>- `eth_feeHistory` now also works with the `finalized` block specifier. ([#25442](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/25442))</br>- The built-in callTracer now supports an option `onlyTopCall`. Enabling this option makes the tracer skip internal calls. We added this option to enable use of the `callTracer` to get the return data of reverted transactions. ([#25430](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/25430))</br></br>#### Go-library changes</br></br>- Storage of trie node hash preimages is now disabled by default. You can enable it again using the `--cache.preimages` flag. ([#25287](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/25287), [#25538](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/25538), [#25533](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/25533))</br>- The ethash mining implemenation now removes temporary DAG files, which could be left of disk when geth was interrupted while generating a DAG. ([#25381](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/25381))</br>- ethclient now supports the `eth_feeHistory` method. ([#25403](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/25403))</br>- The eth wire protocol test suite now supports protocol version eth/67. ([#25306](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/25306))</br>- RLP-decoding of trie nodes is ~33% faster due to reduced allocations in the decoder. ([#25357](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/25357))</br>- The RPC server supports a new option `ReadHeaderTimeout`. ([#25338](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/25338))</br>- Registering of clef ruleset UIs should now work correctly. ([#25455](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/25455))</br></br>#### Build</br></br>- Geth binaries in docker are now statically-linked. ([#25492](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/25492))</br>- This release is built using Go 1.18.5. ([#25461](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/25461))</br></br>For a full rundown of the original merge release changes please consult the Geth [1.10.22 release milestone](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/milestone/134?closed=1).</td>

      <td>Version 1.9.2 of `rippled`, the reference server implementation of the XRP Ledger protocol, is now available. This release includes several fixes and improvements, including a second new fix amendment to correct a bug in Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) code, a new API method for order book changes, less noisy logging, and other small fixes.</br></br>&lt;!-- BREAK --&gt;</br></br></br>## Action Required</br></br>This release introduces a two new amendments to the XRP Ledger protocol. The first, **fixNFTokenNegOffer**, fixes a bug in code associated with the **NonFungibleTokensV1** amendment, originally introduced in [version 1.9.0](https://xrpl.org/blog/2022/rippled-1.9.0.html). The second, **NonFungibleTokensV1_1**, is a "roll-up" amendment that enables the **NonFungibleTokensV1** feature plus the two fix amendments associated with it, **fixNFTokenDirV1** and **fixNFTokenNegOffer**.</br></br>If you want to enable NFT code on the XRP Ledger Mainnet, you can vote in favor of only the **NonFungibleTokensV1_1** amendment to support enabling the feature and fixes together, without risk that the unfixed NFT code may become enabled first.</br></br>These amendments are now open for voting according to the XRP Ledger's [amendment process](https://xrpl.org/amendments.html), which enables protocol changes following two weeks of &gt;80% support from trusted validators.</br></br>If you operate an XRP Ledger server, then you should upgrade to version 1.9.2 within two weeks, to ensure service continuity. The exact time that protocol changes take effect depends on the voting decisions of the decentralized network.</br></br>For more information about NFTs on the XRP Ledger, see [NFT Conceptual Overview](https://xrpl.org/nft-conceptual-overview.html).</br></br>## Install / Upgrade</br></br>On supported platforms, see the [instructions on installing or updating `rippled`](https://xrpl.org/install-rippled.html).</br></br>## Changelog</br></br>This release contains the following features and improvements.</br></br>- **Introduce fixNFTokenNegOffer amendment.** This amendment fixes a bug in the Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) functionality provided by the NonFungibleTokensV1 amendment (not currently enabled on Mainnet). The bug allowed users to place offers to buy tokens for negative amounts of money when using Brokered Mode. Anyone who accepted such an offer would transfer the token _and_ pay money. This amendment explicitly disallows offers to buy or sell NFTs for negative amounts of money, and returns an appropriate error code. This also corrects the error code returned when placing offers to buy or sell NFTs for negative amounts in Direct Mode. ([8266d9d](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/commit/8266d9d598d19f05e1155956b30ca443c27e119e))</br>- **Introduce `NonFungibleTokensV1_1` amendment.** This amendment encompasses three NFT-related amendments: the original NonFungibleTokensV1 amendment (from version 1.9.0), the fixNFTokenDirV1 amendment (from version 1.9.1), and the new fixNFTokenNegOffer amendment from this release. This amendment contains no changes other than enabling those three amendments together; this allows validators to vote in favor of _only_ enabling the feature and fixes at the same time. ([59326bb](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/commit/59326bbbc552287e44b3a0d7b8afbb1ddddb3e3b))</br>- **Handle invalid port numbers.** If the user specifies a URL with an invalid port number, the server would silently attempt to use port 0 instead. Now it raises an error instead. This affects admin API methods and config file parameters for downloading history shards and specifying validator list sites. ([#4213](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/pull/4213))</br>- **Reduce log noisiness.** Decreased the severity of benign log messages in several places: "addPathsForType" messages during regular operation, expected errors during unit tests, and missing optional documentation components when compiling from source. ([#4178](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/pull/4178), [#4166](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/pull/4166), [#4180](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/pull/4180))</br>- **Fix race condition in history shard implementation and support clang's ThreadSafetyAnalysis tool.**  Added build settings so that developers can use this feature of the clang compiler to analyze the code for correctness, and fix an error found by this tool, which was the source of rare crashes in unit tests. ([#4188](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/pull/4188))</br>- **Prevent crash when rotating a database with missing data.** When rotating databases, a missing entry could cause the server to crash. While there should never be a missing database entry, this change keeps the server running by aborting database rotation. ([#4182](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/pull/4182))</br>- **Fix bitwise comparison in OfferCreate.** Fixed an expression that incorrectly used a bitwise comparison for two boolean values rather than a true boolean comparison. The outcome of the two comparisons is equivalent, so this is not a transaction processing change, but the bitwise comparison relied on compilers to implicitly fix the expression. ([#4183](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/pull/4183))</br>- **Disable cluster timer when not in a cluster.** Disabled a timer that was unused on servers not running in clustered mode. The functionality of clustered servers is unchanged. ([#4173](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/pull/4173))</br>- **Limit how often to process peer discovery messages.** In the peer-to-peer network, servers periodically share IP addresses of their peers with each other to facilitate peer discovery. It is not necessary to process these types of messages too often; previously, the code tracked whether it needed to process new messages of this type but always processed them anyway. With this change, the server no longer processes peer discovery messages if it has done so recently. ([#4202](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/pull/4202))</br>- **Improve STVector256 deserialization.** Optimized the processing of this data type in protocol messages. This data type is used in several types of ledger entry that are important for bookkeeping, including directory pages that track other ledger types, amendments tracking, and the ledger hashes history. ([#4204](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/pull/4204))</br>- **Fix and refactor spinlock code.** The spinlock code, which protects the `SHAMapInnerNode` child lists, had a mistake that allowed the same child to be repeatedly locked under some circumstances. Fixed this bug and improved the spinlock code to make it easier to use correctly and easier to verify that the code works correctly. ([#4201](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/pull/4201))</br>- **Improve comments and contributor documentation.** Various minor documentation changes including some to reflect the fact that the source code repository is now owned by the XRP Ledger Foundation. ([#4214](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/pull/4214), [#4179](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/pull/4179), [#4222](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/pull/4222))</br>- **Introduces a new API book_changes to provide information in a format that is useful for building charts that highlight DEX activity at a per-ledger level.**  ([#4212](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/pull/4212))</br></br>## Contributions</br></br>### GitHub</br></br>The public source code repository for `rippled` is hosted on GitHub at &lt;https://github.com/ripple/rippled&gt;.</br></br>We welcome contributions, big and small, and invite everyone to join the community of XRP Ledger developers and help us build the Internet of Value.</br></br>### Credits</br></br>The following people contributed directly to this release:</br></br>- Chenna Keshava B S &lt;ckbs.keshava56@gmail.com&gt;</br>- Ed Hennis &lt;ed@ripple.com&gt;</br>- Ikko Ashimine &lt;eltociear@gmail.com&gt;</br>- Nik Bougalis &lt;nikb@bougalis.net&gt;</br>- Richard Holland &lt;richard.holland@starstone.co.nz&gt;</br>- Scott Schurr &lt;scott@ripple.com&gt;</br>- Scott Determan &lt;scott.determan@yahoo.com&gt;</br></br>For a real-time view of all lifetime contributors, including links to the commits made by each, please visit the "Contributors" section of the GitHub repository: &lt;https://github.com/ripple/rippled/graphs/contributors&gt;.</td>

      <td># Release Notes for Bitcoin Cash Node version 24.1.0</br></br>Bitcoin Cash Node version 24.1.0 is now available from:</br></br>  &lt;https://bitcoincashnode.org&gt;</br></br>## Overview</br></br>This is a minor release of Bitcoin Cash Node (BCHN), containing:</br></br>- Upgrade of TOR network support from v2 to v3</br>- Upgrade checkpoints for May 15, 2022 upgrade</br></br>This version contains many further corrections and improvements and modifies the storage format of the internal peer database to accommodate new network address formats.</br></br></br>## Usage recommendations</br></br>Users who are running v24.0.0 are encouraged to upgrade to v24.1.0. It offers up to date TOR network support, improves synching performance and fixes minor bugs.</br></br>MacOSX users who are running on OS versions prior Mojave (10.14), such as 10.12 or 10.13, and who are running 24.0.0 release binaries, are advised to keep running 24.0.0 until they can upgrade to Mojave.</br></br></br>## Network changes</br></br>- The Tor onion service that is automatically created by setting the  `-listenonion` configuration parameter will now be created as a Tor v3 service instead of Tor v2. The private key that was used for Tor v2 (if any) will be left untouched in the `onion_private_key` file in the data directory (see `-datadir`) and can be removed if not needed. Bitcoin Cash Node will no longer attempt to read it. The private key for the Tor v3 service will be saved in a file named `onion_v3_private_key`. To use the deprecated Tor v2 service (not recommended), then `onion_private_key` can be copied over `onion_v3_private_key`, e.g. `cp -f onion_private_key onion_v3_private_key`.</br></br>- If using the `-listenonion=1` option (default: 1 if unspecified), then an additional new bind `address:port` will be used for hidden-service-only incoming .onion connections. On mainnet, this will be 127.0.0.1:8334. This bind address is in **addition** to any `-bind=` options specified on the CLI and/or in the config file.</br>    - To specify the local onion port to bind to explicitly, use the new syntax, `-bind=&lt;HOST&gt;:&lt;PORT&gt;=onion`. See `bitcoind -help` for more information on the new `=onion` syntax which is used to specify local tor listening ports.</br>    - To not create an additional bind endpoint for tor, and/or to disable tor hidden service support, use `-listenonion=0`.</br></br>  Note: As before, tor hidden services are always advertised publicly using a "generic" port for maximal anonymity (such as 8333 on mainnet, 18333 on testnet3, and so on). The `-bind=&lt;HOST&gt;:&lt;PORT&gt;=onion` syntax is to simply specify the local bind address which is connected-to privately by the local `tor` process when a remote node connects to your .onion hidden service.</br></br>## Added functionality</br></br>- Added wallet-tool</br></br>- Added a new logging option, `-debug=httptrace` which logs all HTTP data to/from the internal JSON-RPC and REST server, including HTTP content.</br>    - This is an advanced debugging option intended for troubleshooting the low-level JSON-RPC and/or REST protocol, primarily aimed at developers.</br>    - This option is not enabled by default, even if using `-debug=all`, and must be explicitly enabled using `-debug=httptrace`.</br>    - Unlike the regular `-debug=http` debug option, incoming strings and data are *not* sanitized in any way in the log file, and are simply logged verbatim as they come in off the network.</br></br>## Deprecated functionality</br></br>The `setexcessiveblock` RPC method has been deprecated. Please use the `excessiveblocksize` configuration option together with a restart of the node if you want to adapt this parameter.</br></br>An upgrade to Qt version 5.15.3 is planned for our next release.  As a result, compatibility of the release binary with some older Linux platforms will be affected:</br></br>- Support for glibc versions older than 2.27 is now deprecated and may no longer be supported in a future release. This will impact older </br>  platforms like CentOS 7, Debian 9, Mint 19, and Ubuntu 14 &amp; 16.</br>- Support for platforms that lack the X protocol C-language Binding library (libxcb) is deprecated, and future releases may require this library.</br>    - This library seems available on most major Linux distributions but we urge you to check your node platform and notify us via a GitLab issue or via a comment on [MR 1524](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/merge_requests/1523) if you do not have this library.</br></br>If you are presently running on such older platforms, please upgrade to a newer OS version ahead of our next release.</br></br>## Modified functionality</br></br>- Netmasks that contain 1-bits after 0-bits (the 1-bits are not contiguous on the left side, e.g. 255.0.255.255) are no longer accepted. They are invalid according to RFC 4632.</br></br>- The `-whitelistrelay` default has been restored to enabled. The help text indicated the default being enabled, despite the default actually being disabled. This has been broken since v22.0.0.</br></br>### peers.dat file format</br></br>The node's known peers are persisted to disk in a file called `peers.dat`. The format of this file has been changed in a backwards-incompatible way in order to accommodate the storage of Tor v3 and other BIP155 addresses. This means that if the file is modified by this version or newer then older versions will not be able to read it. Those old versions, in the event of a downgrade, will log an error message that deserialization has failed and will continue normal operation as if the file was missing, creating a new empty one.</br></br></br>## Removed functionality</br></br>TORv2 support is replaced by TORv3.</br></br>## New RPC methods</br></br>None.</br></br>## User interface changes</br></br>- `peers.dat` file has changed format due to BIP155 / TORv3 support</br>- `-blocksonly` option has been unhidden on bitcoind / bitcoin-qt command line help</br>- `walletlock`, `walletpassphrase` and `walletpassphrasechange` RPC methods were lacking documentation, which has been added.</br></br>## Regressions</br></br>Bitcoin Cash Node 24.1.0 does not introduce any known regressions as compared to 24.0.0.</br></br>## Known Issues</br></br>Some issues could not be closed in time for release, but we are tracking all of them on our GitLab repository.</br></br>- MacOS versions earlier than 10.14 are no longer supported. Additionally, Bitcoin Cash Node does not yet change appearance when macOS "dark mode" is activated.</br></br>- Windows users are recommended not to run multiple instances of bitcoin-qt or bitcoind on the same machine if the wallet feature is enabled.</br>  There is risk of data corruption if instances are configured to use the same wallet folder.</br></br>- Some users have encountered unit tests failures when running in WSL environments (e.g. WSL/Ubuntu).  At this time, WSL is not considered a supported environment for the software. This may change in future.</br></br>  The functional failure on WSL is tracked in [Issue #33](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/33). It arises when competing node program instances are not prevented from opening the same wallet folder. Running multiple program instances with the same configured walletdir could potentially lead to data corruption. The failure has not been observed on other operating systems so far.</br></br>- `doc/dependencies.md` needs revision ([Issue #65](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/65)).</br></br>- For users running from sources built with BerkeleyDB releases newer than the 5.3 which is used in this release, please take into consideration the database format compatibility issues described in [Issue #34](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/34). When building from source it is recommended to use BerkeleyDB 5.3 as this avoids wallet database incompatibility issues with the official release.</br></br>- The `test_bitcoin-qt` test executable fails on Linux Mint 20 (see [Issue #144](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/144)). This does not otherwise appear to impact the functioning of the BCHN software on that platform.</br></br>- With a certain combination of build flags that included disabling the QR code library, a build failure was observed where an erroneous linking against the QR code library (not present) was attempted ([Issue #138](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/138)).</br></br>- Possible out-of-memory error when starting bitcoind with high excessiveblocksize value ([Issue #156](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/156))</br></br>- A problem was observed on scalenet where nodes would sometimes hang for around 10 minutes, accepting RPC connections but not responding to them (see [Issue #210](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/210)).</br></br>- Startup and shutdown time of nodes on scalenet can be long (see [Issue #313](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/313)).</br></br>- On Mac platforms with current Qt, the splash screen can be maximized, but it cannot be unmaximized again (see [Issue #255](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/255)). This issue will be resolved by a Qt library upgrade in a future release.</br></br>- Race condition in one of the `p2p_invalid_messages.py` tests (see [Issue #409](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/409)).</br></br>- Occasional failure in bchn-txbroadcastinterval.py (see [Issue #403](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/403)).</br></br>- wallet_keypool.py test failure when run as part of suite on certain many-core platforms (see [Issue #380](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/380)).</br></br>- Spurious 'insufficient funds' failure during p2p_stresstest.py benchmark (see [Issue #377](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/377)).</br></br>- `bitcoin-tx` tool does not have BIP69 support (optional or enforced) yet (see [Issue #383](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/383)).</br></br>- secp256k1 now no longer works with latest openssl3.x series. There are workarounds (see [Issue #364](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/364)).</br></br>- Spurious `AssertionError: Mempool sync timed out` in several tests (see [Issue #357](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/357)).</br></br>---</br></br>## Changes since Bitcoin Cash Node 24.0.0</br></br>### New documents</br></br>- `doc/bitcoin-conf.md`: restored and updated bitcoin.conf documentation</br></br>### Removed documents</br></br>None.</br></br>### Requirement for MacOSX 10.15 SDK for OSX dependency builders</br></br>Developers who want to build the dependencies for MacOSX or do Gitian builds, should follow documented instructions to replace the 10.14 SDK with the 10.15 version.
