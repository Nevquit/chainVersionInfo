      <td>This is a new minor version release, including important security updates and changes to network efficiency.</br></br>**All Dogecoin Core users - miners, services, relay operators and wallet users - are strongly recommended to upgrade.**</br></br>A full description of all changes is available in the [release notes](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes.md)</br></br>### Security-related fixes</br></br>This release contains multiple security related fixes:</br></br>- The alert system has been removed and processing of alert messages has been disabled</br>- The transaction download system has been made more reliable</br>- The protocol implementation has been amended to reject buggy or malformed messages</br>- Memory management in events of high network traffic or when connected to extremely slow peers has been improved</br></br>### Fee Recommendation</br></br>This release changes the **recommended dust limit** for all participants on the Dogecoin network from 1 DOGE to **0.01 DOGE**. The full recommendation can be found [in the documentation](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/blob/1.14.6-dev/doc/fee-recommendation.md).</br></br>### Breaking changes</br></br>- The behavior of the `dumpwallet` and `backupwallet` RPC methods, to exclusively write to the directory specified by `-backupdir` and no longer overwrite files</br>- The maximum number of `addnode` records that a node will track has been limited to 800</br></br>### New features</br></br>- A new RPC method, `liststucktransactions` has been added to help wallet operators identify if any transactions are stuck (have not been mined and are not in the mempool) and enable resolution. This helps in cases where node-local fee or dust policies change, to prevent the node from sending out old transactions that got lost.</br>- Pruning configuration has been added to the UI, to make it easier to save diskspace for users of graphical (wallet) installations. </br>- A new RPC method, `setmaxconnections`, has been introduced that enables wallet and node operators to change the maximum number of connections their node allows without needing to restart allowing for more fine-grained control of the node's network capacities.</br>- The graph in the UI's traffic monitor has been significantly improved by keeping track of the traffic we see in the background and then rendering it on demand, at any desired scale.</br>- A new RPC method, `rescan`, has been added to allow node operators to rescan the chain for wallet transactions from a certain height. This can help speed up the rescan process for keys that are known to be generated after a certain date or block height.</br>- A new endpoint has been added to the REST server to find the current best known block at a certain height, without having to do RPC calls. This is useful for service implementations that need to track or query blocks.</br></br>### Translation updates</br></br>- Bulgarian</br>- Dutch</br>- French</br>- Italian</br>- Korean</br>- Persian</br>- Portuguese (pt_PT)</br>- Tamil</br></br>### RPC API Changes</br></br>- The `verifychain` RPC command no longer accepts negative values</br>- `addnode` will now return error -32 when the address provided is too long</br>- `getpeerinfo` provides 2 new fields per peer, `addr_processed` and `addr_rate_limited`</br></br>### Dependency updates</br></br>- Updated `zlib` to 1.2.12.</br>- Updated `libevent` to 2.1.12-stable.</br>- Update the LevelDB subtree to use the same version as Bitcoin 22.0, from the [bitcoin-core maintained fork](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/leveldb-subtree).</br></td>

      <td>Version 1.12.0 of `rippled`, the reference server implementation of the XRP Ledger protocol, is now available. This release adds new features and bug fixes, and introduces these amendments:</br></br>- `AMM`</br>- `Clawback`</br>- `fixReducedOffersV1`</br></br>AMM performance testing scripts are available at https://github.com/ripple/RX-Performance-Public.</br></br>[Sign Up for Future Release Announcements](https://groups.google.com/g/ripple-server)</br></br>&lt;!-- BREAK --&gt;</br></br>## Action Required</br></br>Three new amendments are now open for voting according to the XRP Ledger's [amendment process](https://xrpl.org/amendments.html), which enables protocol changes following two weeks of &gt;80% support from trusted validators.</br></br>If you operate an XRP Ledger server, upgrade to version 1.12.0 by September 20, 2023 to ensure service continuity. The exact time that protocol changes take effect depends on the voting decisions of the decentralized network.</br></br></br>## Install / Upgrade</br></br>On supported platforms, see the [instructions on installing or updating `rippled`](https://xrpl.org/install-rippled.html).</br></br>The XRPL Foundation publishes portable binaries, which are drop-in replacements for the `rippled` daemon. [See information and downloads for the portable binaries](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled-portable-builds#portable-builds-of-the-rippled-server). This will work on most distributions, including Ubuntu 16.04, 18.04, 20.04, and 22.04; CentOS; and others. Please test and open issues on GitHub if there are problems.</br></br>## Changelog</br></br>### Amendments, New Features, and Changes</br>(These are changes which may impact or be useful to end users. For example, you may be able to update your code/workflow to take advantage of these changes.)</br></br>- **`AMM`**: Introduces an automated market maker (AMM) protocol to the XRP Ledger's decentralized exchange, enabling you to trade assets without a counterparty. For more information about AMMs, see: [Automated Market Maker](https://opensource.ripple.com/docs/xls-30d-amm/amm-uc/). [#4294](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/pull/4294)</br></br>- **`Clawback`** ([XLS-39](https://github.com/XRPLF/XRPL-Standards/blob/master/XLS-39d-clawback/README.md)): Adds a setting, *Allow Clawback*, which lets an issuer recover, or _claw back_, tokens that they previously issued. Issuers cannot enable this setting if they have issued tokens already. For additional documentation on this feature, see: [#4553](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/pull/4553).</br></br>- **`fixReducedOffersV1`**: Reduces the occurrence of order books that are blocked by reduced offers. [#4512](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/pull/4512)</br></br>- Added WebSocket and RPC port info to `server_info` responses. [#4427](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/pull/4427)</br></br>- Removed the deprecated `accepted`, `seqNum`, `hash`, and `totalCoins` fields from the `ledger` method. [#4244](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/pull/4244)</br></br></br>### Bug Fixes and Performance Improvements</br>(These are behind-the-scenes improvements, such as internal changes to the code, which are not expected to impact end users.)</br></br>- Added a pre-commit hook that runs the clang-format linter locally before committing changes. To install this feature, see: [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/XRPLF/xrpl-dev-portal/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). [#4599](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/pull/4599)</br></br>- In order to make it more straightforward to catch and handle overflows: changed the output type of the `mulDiv()` function from `std::pair&lt;bool, uint64_t&gt;` to `std::optional`.

      <td># Release Notes for Bitcoin Cash Node version 27.0.0</br></br>Bitcoin Cash Node version 27.0.0 is now available from:</br></br>  &lt;https://bitcoincashnode.org&gt;</br></br>## Overview</br></br>This is a major release of Bitcoin Cash Node (BCHN) that implements the [May 15, 2024 Network Upgrade](https://upgradespecs.bitcoincashnode.org/2024-05-15-upgrade/).</br></br>This release implements the following consensus CHIPs:</br></br>- [CHIP-2023-04 Adaptive Blocksize Limit Algorithm for Bitcoin Cash](https://gitlab.com/0353F40E/ebaa) commit `ba9ed768` (19 Nov 2023)</br></br>This version contains various additional minor corrections and improvements.</br></br>Users who are running any of our previous releases (25.0.0 or v26.x.0) are urged to upgrade to v27.0.0 ahead of 15 May 2024.</br></br>## Usage recommendations</br></br>The update to Bitcoin Cash Node 27.0.0 is required for the May 15, 2024 Bitcoin Cash network upgrade.</br></br>## Network changes</br></br>This major release implements the Adaptive Blocksize Limit Algorithm for Bitcoin Cash, which is a change to consensus rules that allows the maximum block size to gradually increase and decrease based on how full blocks are.</br></br>## Added functionality</br></br>- Added configuration option `-percentblockmaxsize` which is an alternative to `-blockmaxsize`. `-percentmaxblocksize` can be used to configure the node's maximum mined block size as a percentage of the maximum block size for the network. So for instance the default on mainnet is `-percentblockmaxsize=50.0` (16 MB). Can be any value from 0.0 to 100.0.</br></br>## Deprecated functionality</br></br>- While 32-bit builds are still supported in this release, they are deprecated and planned to be removed from BCHN after the May 2024 upgrade.</br></br>## Modified functionality</br></br>- The -excessiveblocksize configuration value has modified semantics pre-upgrade vs post-upgrade. After ABLA activates, it acts as a floor value as the base "minimum" max block size.</br>- Added an additional returned data item to the `getmininginfo` RPC:</br>  "miningblocksizelimit", which is the block size limit used for mining as configured for the node by e.g.: `-blockmaxsize`.</br>- The Qt GUI RPC console now is fixed to match the HTTP RPC with respect to stateful "config related" commands. Commands such as `getmininginfo` and `getexcessiveblock` now match the actual node config (and the HTTP RPC).</br>- The default size cap for mining blocks has been set to 50% of the capacity on networks where it has previously been set to 25%. This effectively increases the soft (mining) blocksize default from 8MB to 16MB. Mining pools that wish to generate bigger or smaller blocks can still adjust the configuration option as usual.</br></br>## Removed functionality</br></br>None.</br></br>## New RPC methods</br></br>A 'fillmempool' RPC method has been added for regtest.</br></br>## User interface changes</br></br>- The new configuration option `-percentblockmaxsize` has been added. It is described in more detail in the "Added functionality" section above.</br></br>## Regressions</br></br>Bitcoin Cash Node 27.0.0 does not introduce any known regressions as compared to 26.1.0.</br></br>## Limitations</br></br>The following are limitations in this release of which users should be aware:</br></br>1. CashToken support is low-level at this stage. The wallet application does not yet keep track of the user's tokens.</br>   Tokens are only manageable via RPC commands currently. They only persist through the UTXO database and block database at this</br>   point.</br>   There are existing RPC commands to list and filter for tokens in the UTXO set.</br>   RPC raw transaction handling commands have been extended to allow creation (and sending) of token transactions.</br>   Interested users are advised to consult the functional test in `test/functional/bchn-rpc-tokens.py` for examples on token transaction</br>   construction and listing.</br>   Future releases will aim to extend the RPC API with more convenient ways to create and spend tokens, as well as upgrading the wallet storage and indexing subsystems to persistently store data about tokens of interest to the user. Later we expect to add GUI wallet management of Cash Tokens.</br></br>2. Transactions with SIGHASH_UTXO are not covered by DSProofs at present.</br></br>3. P2SH-32 is not used by default in the wallet (regular P2SH-20 remains the default wherever P2SH is treated).</br></br>4. The markup of Double Spend Proof events in the wallet does not survive a restart of the wallet, as the information is not persisted to the wallet.</br></br>5. The ABLA algorithm for BCH is currently temporarily set to cap the max block size at 2GB. This is due to limitations in the p2p protocol (as well as the block data file format in BCHN).</br></br>## Known Issues</br></br>Some issues could not be closed in time for release, but we are tracking all of them on our GitLab repository.</br></br>- The minimum macOS version is 10.14 (Mojave). Earlier macOS versions are no longer supported.</br></br>- Windows users are recommended not to run multiple instances of bitcoin-qt or bitcoind on the same machine if the wallet feature is enabled. There is risk of data corruption if instances are configured to use the same wallet folder.</br></br>- Some users have encountered unit tests failures when running in WSL environments (e.g. WSL/Ubuntu).  At this time, WSL is not considered a supported environment for the software. This may change in future. It has been reported that using WSL2 improves the issue.</br></br>- `doc/dependencies.md` needs revision ([Issue #65](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/65)).</br></br>- For users running from sources built with BerkeleyDB releases newer than the 5.3 which is used in this release, please take into consideration the database format compatibility issues described in [Issue #34](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/34). When building from source it is recommended to use BerkeleyDB 5.3 as this avoids wallet database incompatibility issues with the official release.</br></br>- The `test_bitcoin-qt` test executable fails on Linux Mint 20 (see [Issue #144](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/144)). This does not otherwise appear to impact the functioning of the BCHN software on that platform.</br></br>- With a certain combination of build flags that included disabling the QR code library, a build failure was observed where an erroneous linking against the QR code library (not present) was attempted ([Issue #138](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/138)).</br></br>- Possible out-of-memory error when starting bitcoind with high excessiveblocksize value ([Issue #156](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/156))</br></br>- A problem was observed on scalenet where nodes would sometimes hang for around 10 minutes, accepting RPC connections but not responding to them (see [#210](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/210)).</br></br>- Startup and shutdown time of nodes on scalenet can be long (see [Issue #313](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/313)).</br></br>- Race condition in one of the `p2p_invalid_messages.py` tests (see [Issue #409](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/409)).</br></br>- Occasional failure in bchn-txbroadcastinterval.py (see [Issue #403](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/403)).</br></br>- wallet_keypool.py test failure when run as part of suite on certain many-core platforms (see [Issue #380](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/380)).</br></br>- Spurious 'insufficient funds' failure during p2p_stresstest.py benchmark (see [Issue #377](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/377)).</br></br>- If compiling from source, secp256k1 now no longer works with latest openssl3.x series.  There are workarounds (see [Issue #364](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/364)).</br></br>- Spurious `AssertionError: Mempool sync timed out` in several tests (see [Issue #357](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/357)).</br></br>- For some platforms, there may be a need to install additional libraries in order to build from source (see [Issue #431](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/431) and discussion in [MR 1523](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/merge_requests/1523)).</br></br>- More TorV3 static seeds may be needed to get `-onlynet=onion` working (see [Issue #429](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/429)).</br></br>- Memory usage can be very high if repeatedly doing RPC `getblock` with verbose=2 on a hash of known big blocks (see [Issue #466](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/466)).</br></br>- A GUI crash failure was observed when attempting to encrypt a large imported wallet (see [Issue #490](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/490)).</br></br>- Nodes on 32-bit platforms could fail if blocks reach a size over 1GiB (per ABLA this would take multiple years, and by then 32-bit platforms will no longer be supported in any case). Technically, this is because blocks may take 2x-3x as much memory when unserialized into memory as they do when serialized, and 32-bit machines often cannot address more than 2GiB in a userspace process, and can never address more than 4GiB.</br></br>- The 'wallet_multiwallet' functional test fails on latest Arch Linux due to a change in semantics in a dependency (see [Issue #505](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/505)). This is not expected to impact functionality otherwise, only a particular edge case of the test.</br></br>- The 'p2p_extversion' functional test is sensitive to timing issues when run at high load (see [Issue #501](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/501)).</br></br>---</br></br>## Changes since Bitcoin Cash Node 26.1.0</br></br>### New
