Fast forward to today, we've only gone and achieved every single requirement that was scribbled on those pages. Brace yourself as we embark on a thrilling journey of innovation and progress. 🦾</br></br>In this groundbreaking update, Parity takes great pride in [moving the runtime code to the fellowship](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows), marking a significant milestone towards a decentralised network as the code is handed over to the community.</br> </br>Starting from this point forward, we will exclusively focus on releasing the Polkadot node, streamlining its efforts to ensure the continuous development and enhancement of the network.</br></br>📢 Calling all contributors! We invite you to take the lead by [submitting runtime code changes](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes), [suggesting protocol improvements](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs), and [joining the vibrant fellowship](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/manifesto) to foster community growth.

A Price Oracle is used to bring real-world data, such as market prices, onto the blockchain, enabling dApps to access and utilize information that resides outside the blockchain. [#4789](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/pull/4789) </br></br>- fixEmptyDID amendment: Modifies the behavior of the DID amendment: adds an additional check to ensure that DIDs are non-empty when created, and returns a `tecEMPTY_DID` error if the DID would be empty. [#4950](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/pull/4950)</br></br>- fixXChainRewardRounding amendment: Modifies the behavior of the XChainBridge amendment: fixes rounding so reward shares are always rounded down, even when the `fixUniversalNumber` amendment is active. [#4933](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/pull/4933)</br></br>- fixPreviousTxnID amendment: Adds `PreviousTxnID` and `PreviousTxnLgrSequence` as fields to all ledger entries that did not already have them included (`DirectoryNode`, `Amendments`, `FeeSettings`, `NegativeUNL`, and `AMM`). Existing ledger entries will gain the fields whenever transactions modify those entries. [#4751](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/pull/4751). </br></br>- fixAMMv1_1 amendment: Fixes AMM offer rounding and low quality order book offers from blocking the AMM.

      <td># Release Notes for Bitcoin Cash Node version 27.1.0</br></br>Bitcoin Cash Node version 27.1.0 is now available from:</br></br>  &lt;https://bitcoincashnode.org&gt;</br></br>## Overview</br></br>This release of Bitcoin Cash Node (BCHN) includes some bug fixes and important reliability enhancements.</br></br>## Usage recommendations</br></br>Users who are running v27.0.0 or earlier are encouraged to upgrade to v27.1.0 as it includes some bugfixes as well as</br>updated checkpoints for the recently completed (15 May 2024) network upgrade. It also include some performance and</br>reliability fixes related to transaction processing.</br></br>## Network changes</br></br>The internal transaction processing logic for both regular and orphan transactions has been reworked to be more</br>performant and more reliable.</br></br>## Added functionality</br></br>None.</br></br>## Deprecated functionality</br></br>None.</br></br>## Modified functionality</br></br>The command-line option -upgrade10activationtime has been renamed to -upgrade10activationheight and is now height-based,</br>rather than MTP time-based. The next upgrade is still expected to be MTP time-based.</br></br>## Removed functionality</br></br>BIP70 payment request support has been removed from the Qt-based GUI. The</br>reason for this is that BIP70 payment requests have historically suffered</br>from a number of security flaws and maintainence of this feature poses a</br>risk to full node software. Users wishing to use a GUI wallet that supports</br>BIP70  are recommended to use one of the many light wallets such as Electron</br>Cash or Bitcoin.com that continue to support BIP70 payment requests.</br></br>## New RPC methods</br></br>None.</br></br>## User interface changes</br></br>- The `-wipeignore` bitcoin-seeder command line option has been removed. The way the</br>  list of ignored nodes is handled has been broken for many years. Rather than ignoring</br>  nodes *until* a particular time, nodes were being ignored *from* that time. This meant</br>  that ignored nodes that ever reached this timeout would stay ignored forever; and</br>  until that point, they would be processed as often as any other node rather than</br>  being ignored for a cooling-off period as intended. To resolve this, we decided to</br>  simply remove this facility entirely, meaning that nodes will now never be ignored.</br>- The `datadir=` conf file variable appearing both outside and inside a section header in</br>  the conf file works as expected now, and no longer leads to unexpected `blocksdir=`</br>  settings (!1816).</br></br>## Regressions</br></br>Bitcoin Cash Node 27.1.0 does not introduce any known regressions as compared to 27.0.0.</br></br>## Limitations</br></br>The following are limitations in this release of which users should be aware:</br></br>1. CashToken support is low-level at this stage. The wallet application does</br>   not yet keep track of the user's tokens.</br>   Tokens are only manageable via RPC commands currently.</br>   They only persist through the UTXO database and block database at this</br>   point.</br>   There are existing RPC commands to list and filter for tokens in the UTXO set.</br>   RPC raw transaction handling commands have been extended to allow creation</br>   (and sending) of token transactions.</br>   Interested users are advised to consult the functional test in</br>   `test/functional/bchn-rpc-tokens.py` for examples on token transaction</br>   construction and listing.</br>   Future releases will aim to extend the RPC API with more convenient</br>   ways to create and spend tokens, as well as upgrading the wallet storage</br>   and indexing subsystems to persistently store data about tokens of interest</br>   to the user. Later we expect to add GUI wallet management of Cash Tokens.</br></br>2. Transactions with SIGHASH_UTXO are not covered by DSProofs at present.</br></br>3. P2SH-32 is not used by default in the wallet (regular P2SH-20 remains</br>   the default wherever P2SH is treated).</br></br>4. The markup of Double Spend Proof events in the wallet does not survive</br>   a restart of the wallet, as the information is not persisted to the</br>   wallet.</br></br>5. The ABLA algorithm for BCH is currently temporarily set to cap the max block</br>   size at 2GB. This is due to limitations in the p2p protocol (as well as the</br>   block data file format in BCHN).</br></br></br>## Known Issues</br></br>Some issues could not be closed in time for release, but we are tracking all</br>of them on our GitLab repository.</br></br>- The minimum macOS version is 10.14 (Mojave).</br>  Earlier macOS versions are no longer supported.</br></br>- Windows users are recommended not to run multiple instances of bitcoin-qt</br>  or bitcoind on the same machine if the wallet feature is enabled.</br>  There is risk of data corruption if instances are configured to use the same</br>  wallet folder.</br></br>- Some users have encountered unit tests failures when running in WSL</br>  environments (e.g. WSL/Ubuntu).  At this time, WSL is not considered a</br>  supported environment for the software. This may change in future.</br>  It has been reported that using WSL2 improves the issue.</br></br>- `doc/dependencies.md` needs revision (Issue #65).</br></br>- For users running from sources built with BerkeleyDB releases newer than</br>  the 5.3 which is used in this release, please take into consideration</br>  the database format compatibility issues described in Issue #34.</br>  When building from source it is recommended to use BerkeleyDB 5.3 as this</br>  avoids wallet database incompatibility issues with the official release.</br></br>- The `test_bitcoin-qt` test executable fails on Linux Mint 20</br>  (see Issue #144). This does not otherwise appear to impact the functioning</br>  of the BCHN software on that platform.</br></br>- With a certain combination of build flags that included disabling</br>  the QR code library, a build failure was observed where an erroneous</br>  linking against the QR code library (not present) was attempted (Issue #138).</br></br>- Possible out-of-memory error when starting bitcoind with high excessiveblocksize</br>  value (Issue #156)</br></br>- A problem was observed on scalenet where nodes would sometimes hang for</br>  around 10 minutes, accepting RPC connections but not responding to them</br>  (see #210).</br></br>- Startup and shutdown time of nodes on scalenet can be long (see Issue #313).</br></br>- Race condition in one of the `p2p_invalid_messages.py` tests (see Issue #409).</br></br>- Occasional failure in bchn-txbroadcastinterval.py (see Issue #403).</br></br>- wallet_keypool.py test failure when run as part of suite on certain many-core</br>  platforms (see Issue #380).</br></br>- Spurious 'insufficient funds' failure during p2p_stresstest.py benchmark</br>  (see Issue #377).</br></br>- If compiling from source, secp256k1 now no longer works with latest openssl3.x series.</br>  There are workarounds (see Issue #364).</br></br>- Spurious `AssertionError: Mempool sync timed out` in several tests</br>  (see Issue #357).</br></br>- For some platforms, there may be a need to install additional libraries</br>  in order to build from source (see Issue #431 and discussion in MR 1523).</br></br>- More TorV3 static seeds may be needed to get `-onlynet=onion` working</br>  (see Issue #429).</br></br>- Memory usage can be very high if repeatedly doing RPC `getblock` with</br>  verbose=2 on a hash of known big blocks (see Issue #466).</br></br>- A GUI crash failure was observed when attempting to encrypt a large imported</br>  wallet (see Issue #490).</br></br>- Nodes on 32-bit platforms could fail if blocks reach a size over 1GiB</br>  (per ABLA this would take multiple years, and by then 32-bit platforms</br>  will no longer be supported in any case).</br>  Technically, this is because blocks may take 2x-3x as much memory when</br>  unserialized into memory as they do when serialized, and 32-bit machines</br>  often cannot address more than 2GiB in a userspace process, and can never</br>  address more than 4GiB.</br></br>- The 'wallet_multiwallet' functional test fails on latest Arch Linux due to</br>  a change in semantics in a dependency (see Issue #505). This is not</br>  expected to impact functionality otherwise, only a particular edge case</br>  of the test.</br></br>- The 'p2p_extversion' functional test is sensitive to timing issues when</br>  run at high load (see Issue #501).</br></br>---</br></br>## Changes since Bitcoin Cash Node 27.0.0</br></br>### New documents</br></br>None</br></br>### Removed documents</br></br>None</br></br>### Notable commits grouped by functionality</br></br>#### Security or consensus relevant fixes</br></br>- 2443f184a582b2bf726f4fdce131c4cbd4c08324 Add checkpoints for blocks after upgrade10 ABLA activation</br>- 7f862714801cf2ae764e4bc0d74831c8f2ef8920 Switch ABLA (upgrade10) to use height-based activation, rather than MTP</br>- 399f414b4be9539b5b41b4c82d02ba45ff5b3c42 qa: Update chainparams assumevalid and minimumchainwork for 27.1.0</br>- 02c658c8e3d3d2ab3d7c7e2cdbc3137134d2def9 Update chainTxData for main, test3, test4, and chipnet</br></br>#### Interfaces / RPC</br></br>None</br></br>#### Features in internal development: support for UTXO commitments</br></br>None</br></br>### Data directory changes</br></br>- c64905bdd52c227f1901a3d183e20ee7ace6fbf6 Fix for wrong behavior for conf file datadir= inside vs outside a secton</br></br>#### Performance optimizations</br></br>None</br></br>#### GUI</br></br>None</br></br>#### Code quality</br></br>- 4f4fa009aa944d156d81d43dc1e69649eb8d2153 Trivial: Fix compiler warning about unused variable in dsproof_tests.cpp</br>- 706bc01a8a298dcf296a379b2b853d0090cdd8d5 Remove deprecated boost::basename method.</br>- ef2dcc2176a12ddac4f54b73bd372a9748a2c88f Fix compatibility for Boost 1.85 and above</br>- 368c9996c12b36fd700f1ce7c0933d0b020412ba trivial: Fix up the header util/heapoptional.h includes</br>- 0f6a086ce91ff3aa7b2faaa748efa48a3e611d9a Fix spurious ABLA-related warning for pruned nodes</br></br>#### Documentation updates</br></br>- 3c137713ddef3e2cced98866da97c28a0fde5e20 Update copyright year to 2024</br>- 633908d627f65a4f997b17121efea17856295d44 clarify links and link contribution guide from docs</br>- 6fbefbf3b6c1cb80653118f3b21f7da3d8c9d685 Include onlynet option in example bitcoin.conf</br>- 9ffaa384771b1df2c9d88b3829db62957e2b3fba Bump version to 27.1.0 + update release-notes to use this version</br></br>#### Build / general</br></br>None</br></br>#### Build / Linux</br></br>None</br></br>#### Build / Windows</br></br>None</br></br>#### Build / MacOSX</br></br>None</br></br>#### Tests / test framework</br></br>- dba4975cb98f9453cb5084f18e02fe316a0c355a Nit: Fix a missing `%s` in chip_testing_setup.cpp</br>- 233c8cfa7e400b2aa8f4e9b572a8ef0816d617c5 Expected test failure messages regeneration</br>- 2ff9aeaa7ac80c72580b3f6215b641351bfb6752 Expand signing serialization VMB tests</br></br></br>#### Benchmarks</br></br>None</br></br>#### Seeds / seeder software</br></br>- 93e08e6642dbd533cccaac03b79df183dfaba366 Fix seeder checkpoint check</br>- 9cdabd25c642c79bb1857b6fe64696b846e873e4 Fixed a rare crash bug when process runs out of file descriptors</br>- 7ddc65cc572b48be5c31041790190aa71e22bcd7 Fix socket leaks leading to process running out of file descriptors</br></br></br>#### Maintainer tools</br></br>- 6b79e9fef20cb337c17f73bc786ffa7f17120163 linearize: Add the new testnets and rename diskmagic</br></br>#### Infrastructure</br></br>None</br></br>#### Cleanup</br></br>- 37ac1c6058c0aa639297e8166108d15ddc54429b Deleted comments related to segwit.</br></br>#### Continuous Integration (GitLab CI)</br></br>- 610dfff8da4f2ca643bcd6c04c384b07b53254ca Import CI docker image file</br>- b7b2e762105b70f7d739da730e70d4fc73378468 ci: Bump docker image buster -&gt;
