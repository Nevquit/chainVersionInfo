All Dogecoin Core users, miners, services, relay operators and wallet users are strongly recommended to upgrade.</br></br>This release can be installed over an existing 1.14 installation seamlessly, without the need for uninstallation, re-indexation or re-download. Simply shut down your running Dogecoin-QT or dogecoind, perform the installation and restart your node.</br></br>Important Security Updates</br>--------------------------</br></br>This release contains fixes for 2 high severity vulnerabilities that affect most Dogecoin Core users:</br></br>* Remote Code Execution in Dogecoin QT (CVE-2021-3401)</br>* Sensitive Information Exposure on Unix platforms (CVE-2019-15947)</br></br>**Dogecoin QT (Graphical User Interface) users on all platforms and wallet users on the Linux platform are urged to please update their installations to this version immediately**, to prevent malicious actors from exploiting these vulnerabilities.</br></br>Fee Reductions</br>--------------</br></br>This release finalizes a new minimum fee recommendation for all participants on the Dogecoin network, following the reduction of relay and mining defaults in 1.14.4. With this release, the minimum fees when creating transactions are recommended to be as follows:</br></br>* the recommended minimum transaction fee is 0.01 DOGE/kb, and</br>* the recommended dust limit is 1 DOGE, and</br>* the recommended RBF increment is 0.001 DOGE.</br></br>See the full recommendation [here](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/blob/master/doc/fee-recommendation.md)</br></br>RPC API Changes</br>---------------</br></br>* Added `softdustlimit` and `harddustlimit` fields to `getnetworkinfo`</br>* Added `createauxblock` and `submitauxblock` methods</br>* Added `-rpcnamecoinapi` that allows miners to use Namecoin-compatible AuxPoW APIs, for both `getauxblock` and `createauxblock` methods.</br></br>Other notable changes</br>---------------------</br></br>* Updated Berkely DB to 5.3 and OpenSSL to 1.0.2u.</br>* The version displayed on QT's overview page has been changed to display the full version</br>* Updated the HD wallet derivation path to be compliant with [SLIP44](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md) </br>* Updated [the FreeBSD build](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/blob/master/doc/build-freebsd.md).</br>* Added xkbcommon 0.8.4 as a separate dependency to fix keyboard compatibility issues</br>* Added a [getting started guide](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/blob/master/doc/getting-started.md)</br></br>See the [release notes](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes.md) for a full description of this release.</br></td>

      <td>This is a maintenance release. This release contains a lot of work in preparation for The Merge, and work for an upcoming change to the way state is stored in go-ethereum. </br></br>This release also adds a new tool to convert 'legacy' receipts into a newer format. During startup, geth will check the database and tell you if you need to perform the conversion. Converting receipts is only needed if geth's `ancients` database has not been resynced from scratch during the last couple of years. It is recommended to back-up your receipts freezer table (`ancients/receipts*`) before performing the conversion.</br></br>Compatibility note about `core/types`: For optimization purposes, `types.Header` and other types in this package now implement the `rlp.Encoder` interface. This change can cause incompatibilities because the new method is implemented with pointer receiver. Attempting to RLP-encode unadressable (i.e. non-pointer) values of type `Header` does not work anymore and will result in an error.</br></br>### Change Log</br></br>- A lot of work towards "The Merge" (TM) was performed ([#24574](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24574), [#24569](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24569), [#24550](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24550), [#24548](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24548), [#24506](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24506), [#24545](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24545), [#23982](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/23982), [#24522](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24522), [#24364](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24364))</br>- A lot optimizations for RLP encoding and package trie were added (roughly 20-30% improvement) ([#24126](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24126), [#24425](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24425), [#24420](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24420), [#24251](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24251))</br>- Preparatory work for an upcoming for state layout change ([#24460](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24460), [#23954](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/23954), [#24486](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24486), [#24391](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24391), [#24392](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24392))</br>- GraphQL: fee history API methods were added, along with nonce for pending accounts ([#24452](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24452))</br>- The non-cgo fallback secp256k1 crypto library was updated and is now ~25% faster ([#24533](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24533)) </br>- Support for signing nested types via `clef` ([#24407](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24407))</br>- Receipt converter tool ([#24028](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24028))</br>- Our builds were updated to use Go 1.18</br></br>For a full rundown of the changes please consult the Geth 1.10.17 [release milestone](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/milestone/129?closed=1).</br></br>---</br></br>As with all our previous releases, you can find the:</br></br>- Pre-built binaries for all platforms on our [downloads page](https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/).</br>- Docker images published under [`ethereum/client-go`](https://cloud.docker.com/u/ethereum/repository/docker/ethereum/client-go).</br>- Ubuntu packages in our [Launchpad PPA repository](https://launchpad.net/~ethereum/+archive/ubuntu/ethereum).</br>- OSX packages in our [Homebrew Tap repository](https://github.com/ethereum/homebrew-ethereum).</br></br></td>

      <td>Litecoin Core v0.21.2 Release</br>==============</br></br>Follow our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/litecoinproject) for the latest dev news.</br></br>We are pleased to release Litecoin Core 0.21.2. This is a new major version release, including new features, various bugfixes and performance improvements, as well as updated translations. This update includes full node, wallet and mining support for MWEB. It is recommended for all users to upgrade to this version.</br></br>How to upgrade: </br>==============</br></br>Firstly, thank you for running Litecoin Core and helping secure the network!</br></br>As you’re running an older version of Litecoin Core, shut it down. Wait until it’s completely shut down  - which might take a few minutes for older versions - then follow these simple steps:</br>For Windows: simply run the installer </br>For Mac: copy over to `/Applications/Litecoin-Qt` </br>For Linux: copy cover `litecoind`/`litecoin-qt`.</br></br>NB: upgrading directly from an ‘end of life’ version of Litecoin Core is possible, but it might take a while if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old wallet versions of Litecoin Core are generally supported.</br> </br></br>Compatibility:</br>==============</br></br>Litecoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.10+,  Windows 7 and newer. It’s not recommended to use Litecoin Core on unsupported systems.</br></br>Litecoin Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems, but is not as frequently tested on them.</br></br>MWEB fields added to BlockIndex, and block serialization format has changed. Downgrading to older versions is unsafe.</br></br>If upgrading to 0.21.2 *after* MWEB has activated, you must resync to download MWEB blocks.</br></br>Notable changes</br>===============</br></br>Consensus changes</br>-----------------</br></br>- This release implements the proposed MWEB consensus rules</br>  ([LIP002](https://github.com/litecoin-project/lips/blob/master/lip-0002.mediawiki),</br>  [LIP003](https://github.com/litecoin-project/lips/blob/master/lip-0003.mediawiki), and</br>  [LIP004](https://github.com/litecoin-project/lips/blob/master/lip-0004.mediawiki))</br></br>P2P and network changes</br>-----------------------</br></br>- A new service flag, NODE_MWEB (1 &lt;&lt; 24), was added to signal to peers that the node supports MWEB.</br>  When connected peers both advertise this capability, they are expected to provide all MWEB data when</br>  sharing transactions, blocks, and compact blocks with each other.</br></br>- Nodes now announce compact block version 3 support, informing peers that they can provide MWEB data</br>  in compact blocks.</br></br></br>Updated RPCs</br>------------</br></br>- `getblockheader` now returns an additional `mweb_header` field containing</br>  all of the MWEB header data, and an `mweb_amount` field containing the total</br>  number of coins pegged-in to the MWEB after applying the block.</br></br>- `getblock` now returns an additional `mweb` field containing MWEB header info,</br>  and all of the inputs, outputs, and kernels in the MWEB block.</br></br>- Added `mwebweight`, `descendantmwebweight`, `ancestormwebweight`, and `mweb`</br>  fields to `getrawmempool`, `getmempoolancestors`, `getmempooldescendants`,</br>  and `getmempoolentry`.</br></br>- Added new fields to describe MWEB transaction inputs, outputs, and kernels</br>  for `getrawtransaction`.</br></br>Changes to Wallet or GUI related RPCs can be found in the GUI or Wallet section below.</br></br>New settings</br>------------</br></br>- Added "fMWEBFeatures" option for enabling the new "Advanced MWEB Features"</br>  control.</br></br>Wallet Database</br>---------------</br></br>- Added "mweb_coin" type which stores MWEB coins and their derived keys.</br></br>- Added CHDChain version 4 which includes an MWEB key index counter and</br>  the stealth address scan key.</br></br>- Added CKeyMetadata version 14 which includes the MWEB key index.</br></br>- Added FEATURE_MWEB = 210000 minimum database version.</br></br>Wallet RPC changes</br>------------------</br></br>- Added 'listwallettransactions' which matches the transaction list display values.</br></br>GUI changes</br>-----------</br></br>- Added an "Advanced MWEB Features" control for testing. It’s only available</br>  when the "-debug" argument is supplied, and the option is turned on in the</br>  settings dialog.</br></br>Download Binaries</br>=======</br></br>To download, please visit the download page [here](https://litecoin.org/). Alternatively, you can view the download folder [here](https://download.litecoin.org/litecoin-0.21.2/).</br></br>Please use GPG to verify the integrity of the release binaries.

      <td>## Version 1.9.0</br>This is the 1.9.0 release of `rippled`, the reference implementation of the XRP Ledger protocol. This release brings several features and improvements.</br></br>### New and Improved Features</br>- **Introduce NFT support (XLS-20):** This release introduces support for non-fungible tokens, currently available to the developer community for broader review and testing.  Developers can create applications that allow users to mint, transfer, and ultimately burn (if desired) NFTs on the XRP Ledger. You can try out the new NFT transactions using the [nft-devnet](https://xrpl.org/xrp-testnet-faucet.html). Note that some fields and error codes from earlier releases of the supporting code have been refactored for this release, shown in the Code Refactoring section, below. ([70779f](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commit/70779f6850b5f33cdbb9cf4129bc1c259af0013e))</br></br>- **Simplify the Job Queue:** This is a refactor aimed at cleaning up and simplifying the existing job queue. Currently, all jobs are canceled at the same time and in the same way, so this commit removes the unnecessary per-job cancellation token. ([#3656](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3656))</br></br>- **Optimize trust line caching:** The existing trust line caching code was suboptimal in that it stored redundant information, pinned SLEs into memory, and required multiple memory allocations per cached object. This commit eliminates redundant data, reduces the size of cached objects and unpinning SLEs from memory, and uses value types to avoid the need for `std::shared_ptr`. As a result of these changes, the effective size of a cached object includes the overhead of the memory allocator, and the `std::shared_ptr` should be reduced by at least 64 bytes. This is significant, as there can easily be tens of millions of these objects. ([4d5459](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commit/4d5459d041da8f5a349c5f458d664e5865e1f1b5))</br></br>- **Incremental improvements to pathfinding memory usage:** This commit aborts background pathfinding when closed or disconnected, exits the pathfinding job thread if there are no requests left, does not create the path find a job if there are no requests, and refactors to remove the circular dependency between InfoSub and PathRequest. ([#4111](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/4111))</br></br>- **Improve deterministic transaction sorting in TxQ:** This commit ensures that transactions with the same fee level are sorted by TxID XORed with the parent ledger hash, the TxQ is re-sorted after every ledger, and attempts to future-proof the TxQ tie-breaking test. ([#4077](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/4077))</br></br>- **Improve stop signaling for Application:** ([34ca45](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commit/34ca45713244d0defc39549dd43821784b2a5c1d))</br></br>- **Eliminate SHAMapInnerNode lock contention:** The `SHAMapInnerNode` class had a global mutex to protect the array of node children. Profiling suggested that around 4% of all attempts to lock the global would block. This commit removes that global mutex, and replaces it with a new per-node 16-way spinlock (implemented so as not to affect the size of an inner node object), effectively eliminating the lock contention. ([1b9387](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commit/1b9387eddc1f52165d3243d2ace9be0c62495eea))</br></br>- **Improve ledger-fetching logic:** When fetching ledgers, the existing code would isolate the peer that sent the most useful responses, and issue follow-up queries only to that peer. This commit increases the query aggressiveness, and changes the mechanism used to select which peers to issue follow-up queries to so as to more evenly spread the load among those peers that provided useful responses. ([48803a](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commit/48803a48afc3bede55d71618c2ee38fd9dbfd3b0))</br></br>- **Simplify and improve order book tracking:** The order book tracking code would use `std::shared_ptr` to track the lifetime of objects. This commit changes the logic to eliminate the overhead of `std::shared_ptr` by using value types, resulting in significant memory savings. ([b9903b](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commit/b9903bbcc483a384decf8d2665f559d123baaba2))</br></br>- **Negative cache support for node store:** This commit allows the cache to service requests for nodes that were previously looked up but not found, reducing the need to perform I/O in several common scenarios. ([3eb8aa](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commit/3eb8aa8b80bd818f04c99cee2cfc243192709667))</br></br>- **Improve asynchronous database handlers:** This commit optimizes the way asynchronous node store operations are processed, both by reducing the number of times locks are held and by minimizing the number of memory allocations and data copying. ([6faaa9](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commit/6faaa91850d6b2eb9fbf16c1256bf7ef11ac4646))</br></br>- **Cleanup AcceptedLedger and AcceptedLedgerTx:** This commit modernizes the `AcceptedLedger` and `AcceptedLedgerTx` classes, reduces their memory footprint, and reduces unnecessary dynamic memory allocations. ([8f5868](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commit/8f586870917818133924bf2e11acab5321c2b588))</br></br>### Code Refactoring</br></br>This release includes name changes in the NFToken API for SFields, RPC return labels, and error codes for clarity and consistency. To refactor your code, migrate the names of these items to the new names as listed below.</br> </br>#### `SField` name changes:</br>* `TokenTaxon -&gt; NFTokenTaxon`</br>* `MintedTokens -&gt; MintedNFTokens`</br>* `BurnedTokens -&gt; BurnedNFTokens`</br>* `TokenID -&gt; NFTokenID`</br>* `TokenOffers -&gt; NFTokenOffers`</br>* `BrokerFee -&gt; NFTokenBrokerFee`</br>* `Minter -&gt; NFTokenMinter`</br>* `NonFungibleToken -&gt; NFToken`</br>* `NonFungibleTokens -&gt; NFTokens`</br>* `BuyOffer -&gt; NFTokenBuyOffer`</br>* `SellOffer -&gt; NFTokenSellOffer`</br>* `OfferNode -&gt; NFTokenOfferNode`</br> </br>#### RPC return labels</br>* `tokenid -&gt; nft_id`</br>* `index -&gt; nft_offer_index`</br> </br>#### Error codes</br>* `temBAD_TRANSFER_FEE -&gt; temBAD_NFTOKEN_TRANSFER_FEE`</br>* `tefTOKEN_IS_NOT_TRANSFERABLE -&gt; tefNFTOKEN_IS_NOT_TRANSFERABLE`</br>* `tecNO_SUITABLE_PAGE -&gt; tecNO_SUITABLE_NFTOKEN_PAGE`</br>* `tecBUY_SELL_MISMATCH -&gt; tecNFTOKEN_BUY_SELL_MISMATCH`</br>* `tecOFFER_TYPE_MISMATCH -&gt; tecNFTOKEN_OFFER_TYPE_MISMATCH`</br>* `tecCANT_ACCEPT_OWN_OFFER -&gt; tecCANT_ACCEPT_OWN_NFTOKEN_OFFER`</br></br></br>### Bug Fixes</br>- **Fix deletion of orphan node store directories:** Orphaned node store directories should only be deleted if the proper node store directories are confirmed to exist.

      <td># Release Notes for Bitcoin Cash Node version 24.0.0</br></br>Bitcoin Cash Node version 24.0.0 is now available from:</br></br>  &lt;https://bitcoincashnode.org&gt;</br></br>## Overview</br></br>This is a major release of Bitcoin Cash Node (BCHN) that implements the [May 15, 2022 Network Upgrade](https://upgradespecs.bitcoincashnode.org/2022-05-15-upgrade/). This release implements the following two consensus CHIPs:</br></br>- [CHIP-2021-03: Bigger Script Integers](https://gitlab.com/GeneralProtocols/research/chips/-/blob/master/CHIP-2021-02-Bigger-Script-Integers.md) increased precision for arithmetic operations.</br>- [CHIP-2021-02: Native Introspection Opcodes](https://gitlab.com/GeneralProtocols/research/chips/-/blob/master/CHIP-2021-02-Add-Native-Introspection-Opcodes.md) enabling smart contracts to inspect the current transaction.</br></br>This version contains further corrections and improvements, such as:</br></br>- [BIP69](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0069.mediawiki) (privacy) lexicographical sorting of transaction inputs/outputs</br>- A new wallet RPC call attribute ('include_unsafe') which enables creation of transactions which spend unconfirmed outputs (the default is still to spend only confirmed transactions)</br>- New settings, confirmation and error messages for the GUI to detect and warn the user about error-prone legacy address types.</br>- Update of the seeds and addition of a new seeder (bitjson.com)</br></br>Users who are running any of our previous releases (23.x.y) are urged to upgrade to v24.0.0 ahead of May 2022.</br></br></br>## Usage recommendations</br></br>The update to Bitcoin Cash Node 24.0.0 is required for the May 15, 2022 Bitcoin Cash network upgrade.</br></br></br>## Network changes</br></br>This release brings two consensus CHIPs (increased precision for arithmetic operations and native introspection opcodes) and one optional network change - BIP69 - the sorting of inputs and output in transactions generated by the wallet.</br></br>The first two (consensus changes) take effect with the upgrade in 15 May 2022.</br></br>BIP69 is effective immediately and enabled by default in this release. The pre-BIP69 behavior can be obtained by passing `-usebip69=0` on startup.</br></br></br>## Added functionality</br></br>- After activation of the May 2022 upgrade, smart contract designers will be able to use OP_MUL, native introspection opcodes and higher-precision integers in Script code.</br></br>- `coinsel` option has been added to `sendmany` RPC call. This was done to keep uniformity with 'sendtoaddress'.</br></br>- A new option `-usebip69` has been added to toggle BIP69 usage (it is enabled by default). This sorts the inputs and outputs of a transaction</br>  in lexicographical order to increase transactional privacy.</br></br>- The `fundrawtransaction`, `sendmany`, `sendtoaddress` and `walletcreatefundedpsbt` RPCs now support an `include_unsafe` option that, when `true`, allows using "unsafe inputs" to fund the transaction. The term "unsafe inputs" is a synonym for unconfirmed inputs not originating   from the wallet.  Note that the resulting transaction may become invalid if one of the "unsafe" inputs disappears due to a double-spend. This is a very unlikely scenario, however, on account of the strong zero-conf properties of the BCH network.  However, if that happens, the transaction must be funded with different inputs and republished.</br></br>- Two new options have been added to make legacy address handling safer in the GUI wallet: "Allow legacy P2PKH addresses" under Options &gt; Wallet and the `-allowlegacyp2sh` configuration option.</br></br>- A new CLI argument `-bytespersigcheck` has been introduced (conf file: `bytespersigcheck`). It is identical to the existing argument `-bytespersigop` (which has been deprecated), and the two arguments are now aliases for one other.</br></br>- A new option `-upgrade9activationtime` has been added to control the timestamp of the tentative upgrade in May 2023. This value is also used</br>  to set the software expiry time.</br></br>## Deprecated functionality</br></br>- The CLI argument `-bytespersigop` (conf file: `bytespersigop`) has been deprecated. Use `-bytespersigcheck` instead.</br></br>## Modified functionality</br></br>- The software expiry deadline has now been shifted from 15 May 2022 to 15 May 2023.</br></br>## Removed functionality</br></br>### autotools build system</br></br>The autotools build system is no longer supported by BCHN and has been removed. Please use the CMake / ninja build system.</br></br>### Mempool acceptance 'height' field in RPC calls</br></br>The `getmempoolentry` RPC call, the verbose modes of the `getrawmempool`/`getmempoolancestors`/`getmempooldescendants` RPC calls, and the JSON mode of the mempool REST call no longer include the `height` field. This used to indicate the block height upon mempool acceptance. However, it was not guaranteed to be accurate after a node restart or reorg, thus limiting its usefulness. Since it has been marked as deprecated for some time, it has been removed in the interests of efficiency.</br></br>### No more PPA support for Ubuntu 16.04</br></br>Ubuntu 16.04 is no longer supported via a PPA.</br></br>Users are encouraged to migrate to a more recent version of Ubuntu if they wish to use the Ubuntu PPAs.</br></br>Users who wish to compile from source are advised that the autotools build system is no longer supported from this release onwards.</br></br>## New RPC methods</br></br>None.</br></br>## User interface changes</br></br>Legacy address handling has been made safer in the GUI wallet. The aim is to save users from losing coins while using the error-prone legacy P2PKH and P2SH address types.</br></br>Such receiving address types are detected and the user is given relevant confirmation dialogs and error messages. For this legacy address handling, two new settings are introduced, one for P2PKH and one for P2SH addresses, to configure whether or not use of these legacy address types is allowed. These settings are:</br></br>- "Allow legacy P2PKH addresses" under Options &gt; Wallet</br>- `-allowlegacyp2sh` configuration option</br></br>## Regressions</br></br>Bitcoin Cash Node 24.0.0 does not introduce any known regressions as compared to 23.1.0.</br></br>## Known Issues</br></br>Some issues could not be closed in time for release, but we are tracking all of them on our GitLab repository.</br></br>- MacOS versions earlier than 10.12 are no longer supported. Additionally, Bitcoin Cash Node does not yet change appearance when macOS "dark mode" is activated.</br></br>- Windows users are recommended not to run multiple instances of bitcoin-qt or bitcoind on the same machine if the wallet feature is enabled.</br>  There is risk of data corruption if instances are configured to use the same wallet folder.</br></br>- Some users have encountered unit tests failures when running in WSL environments (e.g. WSL/Ubuntu).  At this time, WSL is not considered a supported environment for the software. This may change in future. The functional failure on WSL is tracked in [Issue #33](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/33). It arises when competing node program instances are not prevented from opening the same wallet folder. Running multiple program instances with the same configured walletdir could potentially lead to data corruption. The failure has not been observed on other operating systems so far.</br></br>- `doc/dependencies.md` needs revision ([Issue #65](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/65)).</br></br>- `test_bitcoin` can collide with temporary files if used by more than one user on the same system simultaneously. ([Issue #43](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/43))</br></br>- For users running from sources built with BerkeleyDB releases newer than the 5.3 which is used in this release, please take into consideration the database format compatibility issues described in [Issue #34](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/34). When building from source it is recommended to use BerkeleyDB 5.3 as this voids wallet database incompatibility issues with the official release.</br></br>- The `test_bitcoin-qt` test executable fails on Linux Mint 20 (see [Issue #144](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/144)). This does not otherwise appear to impact the functioning of the BCHN software on that platform.</br></br>- With a certain combination of build flags that included disabling the QR code library, a build failure was observed where an erroneous linking against the QR code library (not present) was attempted ([Issue #138](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/138)).</br></br>- Some functional tests are known to fail spuriously with varying probability. (see e.g. [Issue #148](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/148), and a fuller listing in [Issue #162](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/162)).</br></br>- Possible out-of-memory error when starting bitcoind with high excessiveblocksize value ([Issue #156](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/156))</br></br>- A problem was observed on scalenet where nodes would sometimes hang for around 10 minutes, accepting RPC connections but not responding to them (see [Issue #210](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/210)).</br></br>- Startup and shutdown time of nodes on scalenet can be long (see [Issue #313](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/313)).</br></br>- On some platforms, the splash screen can be maximized, but it cannot be unmaximized again (see [Issue #255](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/255)). This has only been observed on Mac OSX, not on Linux or Windows builds.</br></br>- There is an issue with `git-lfs` that may interfere with the refreshing of source code checkouts which have not been updated for a longer time (see Issues [#326](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/326), [#333](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/333)). A known workaround is to do a fresh clone of the repository.</br></br>---</br></br>## Changes since Bitcoin Cash Node 23.1.0</br></br>### New documents</br></br>The following are new documents in the BCHN software repository:</br></br>- [doc/gitian-building/gitian-building-docker.md](doc/gitian-building/gitian-building-docker.md): Adds a new streamlined Gitian setup guide tailored for Ubuntu/Debian users with Docker</br>- [doc/release-notes/release-notes-23.1.0.md](doc/release-notes/release-notes-23.1.0.md): The previous Release Notes</br></br>### Removed documents</br></br>None.</br></br>### Notable commits grouped by functionality</br></br>#### Security or consensus relevant fixes</br></br>None.</br></br>#### Interfaces / RPC</br></br>- af8ee2666dbd7653240117620ac96084b05fdae0 Bigger script integers (64-bit) implementation</br>- 05681fd0a614688430554b23b76fc01b8addb38a Implement bip69 and use in CWallet::CreateTransaction by default</br>- 4044ae2232059f6e96d2bc84179d56e5b6446506 Implementation of the Native Introspection proposal</br>- eff23d7d95e3cb47ef3f4aacbdcc1fac1347cfd4 Remove mempool acceptance block height field</br></br>#### Performance optimizations</br></br>- 3b44c66d9b10f30a954dac879e71ce0357b92b5a Remove `CTxMemPool::vTxHashes`</br></br>#### GUI</br></br>- 70460780ed480c22a917ca09a9614f1264f974b1 [qt][wallet] Safer legacy address handling for the GUI wallet</br>- 4e48ab0caac1b676a041fddcaba14c66e01f41ae Add guards and replace removed QWidget dependency</br></br>#### Data directory changes</br></br>None.</br></br>#### Code quality</br></br>- 60ae4cb4abf1d2b6d5eb71c2af69da9d39fd5b79 [qa] Fix compile warning about shadowed local in wallet_tests.cpp</br>- 5aba2e5381001c01b54c890e8bd9693f813b4946 [tests] Trivial: End object lifetime properly in a uint256 test</br>- ddfe6f4d4db8f08c165794da6119a63a2b32d682 Fix UB use of reinterpret_cast when working with sockets</br>- cfeb4093db9771889aa54b62985a8afc08b4e3c4 Fix compile warnings on newer clang</br>- bc30e7ad646554bf084e851a35d336b692f63c6f Remove old check for 3-byte shifted IP addresses from pre-0.2.9 node messages</br>- 234798dd814c55b6d44dabf37983a95d5c4b43b6 [qa] Update blockchain data sizes for mainnet, scalenet for v24.0.0</br>- fdb053f4d5666b152dc9751d1d30036798647d3c [qa] Update chain params (assumed valid and chainwork) for v24.0.0</br></br>#### Documentation updates</br></br>- b9edb72b06a1223f1761989be6ad649467f6ac5c [build][doc] Add Gitian on Docker guide &amp;
